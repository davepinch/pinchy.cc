Each page of this website represents a single piece of information such as a bookmark or photograph. Most pages are published to a flat URL structure where all topics are in the root of the site, e.g.,

* [/andromeda/](/andromeda/)
* [/looking-up/](/looking-up/)
* [/self-portrait-concept-art/](/self-portrait-concept-art/)

Bookmarks are an exception to this pattern. The target address of the bookmark is built into the URL structure, e.g.,

* [/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell)
* [/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future)
* [/floor796.com/](/floor796.com/)
