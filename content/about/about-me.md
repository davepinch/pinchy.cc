By happy accident I follow a [brutalist](/brutalist-web.design/) design philosophy where I focus on structure and content rather than appearance. Some time ago I accidentally published the site without stylesheets, revealing a convoluted mess (my CSS was lipstick on a pig). I decided to temporarily remove all stylesheets so I could clean up the HTML - and with time came to appreciate the benefits of simplicity.

Each page of this website represents a single piece of information such as a bookmark or photograph. Most pages are published to a flat URL structure where all topics are in the root of the site, e.g.,

* [/andromeda/](/andromeda/)
* [/looking-up/](/looking-up/)
* [/self-portrait-concept-art/](/self-portrait-concept-art/)

Bookmarks are an exception to this pattern. The target address of the bookmark is built into the URL structure, e.g.,

* [/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell)
* [/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future)
* [/floor796.com/](/floor796.com/)

The site is currently implemented in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). You can find source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/davepinch/pinchy.cc). Feel free to submit any proposed changes. I do not track usage, I do not use cookies, so I have no idea what you think. See [privacy policy](/privacy-policy/), and [contact information](/contact-me/).
