# Medications

* [naloxone](/naloxone) to save the life of someone overdosing on opiods. Naloxone is available without a subscription throughout the United States and may be covered under your insurance.

* [potassium iodide (KI)](/potassium-iodide/) to protect your thyroid from radioactive iodine after a nuclear emergency. Note: KI does not protect you from radiation. It is used to saturate your thyroid with "good" iodine in case radioactive iodine is spread to your environment due to a nuclear emergency. Follow instructions and take the medication only when instructed by emergency authorities. See [Potassium Iodide (KI) - Radiation Emergency Medical Management](/remm.hhs.gov/potassiumiodide.htm).
