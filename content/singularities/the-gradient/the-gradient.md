The Gradient is an interesting world in which the center is a singularity, surrounded by successive rings of well-organized industries. 

On the outskirts are the campers. They live in the forests and the lands, bringing knowledge and artifacts back to the cities. In the cities are the manufacturers. They make products for the campers and themselves. Between the cities and the campers are the famers. They are closer to the wilds than the citizens. At the center are the owners. They own this world, connected to us from a primary world that is abstract.
