it is a challenging boundary between us.
Two pressures against each other, chaotic.
Such turbulence is a good thing.
It demonstrates the robust health of our system.
Lest no side become too strong.
It does not benefit our class to have universal poverty and strife.
A solid foundation provides solidity.
It is the backbone that allows us to rise.
And the poverty that feeds it.
Thank you.
Thank you, on behalf of the rich.
