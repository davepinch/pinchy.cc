Consider an errand to purchase groceries downtown.

If you rent from a landlord, the tenant agreement may require that all tenants and visitors be de-anonymized when walking through common spaces on the property, e.g., hallways. Larger landlords are more likely to require de-anonymization for insurance reasons.

If you live in a neighborhood subject to a HOA (home-owners association), the HOA agreement may require de-anonymization in HOA-managed spaces. It may be possible to avoid de-anonymization if you stick to public roads. However, de-anonymization may be permitted if the roads are privately owned.

By definition, driving requires de-anonymization as a condition of getting a license. To avoid this, you may walk to your destination while staying on public sidewalks. However, you must avoid stepping onto private property such as parking lots that may be subject to de-anonymization.

Taxies, buses, rideshare drivers, etc., may require de-anonymization as a condition of travel.

The grocery store is likely to have a "club membership" model in which de-anonymization is required to take advantage of offers and lower prices. If shoplifting is high, the store may become members only and thus you must be de-anonymized to even enter the store.

In order to pay for your groceries, you must be identified as a condition of making electronic payments. Cash is increasingly discouraged.
