A **scratchpad** contains random ramblings not yet converted to pages.

*AI ticketing* is a set of open standards that enable distributed AI systems to track your physical location while enforcing access permission rules.

A *ticket* contains cryptographically-signed, verifiable data. For example:

* Birth date
* Drivers license number
* Ticket number
* Membership ID
* Physical presence ID

## Issuers

A *issuer* is a system that generates tickets.

Example issuers:
  - A company that sells hardware
  - A social media company
  - An employer
  - A state agency 

An bonded issuer is one that conforms to regulations and best practices, and assumes liability for misidentification based on the variables they consider. The issuer is acreddited by an appropriate accrediting agency.

Digital certificates provide a chain-of-trust such that only ACME can generate ACME tickets, and other systems can verify that tickets came from ACME. Other systems can also decide to not trust ACME.

For example, a card reader will issue a ticket that stipulates a valid license was provided. Or the person is of adult age (or the actual birthdate).

People can decide who they enroll with.

## Tracking

A *tracker* is a certificate that attests to your physical presence. A tracker is typically re-issued as you move around. It provides a basis on which other tickets are attached.

Tickets may be attached to other tickets and stacked together to give a wide view of the person.

A *checkpoint* is a space where AI is permitted to identify the person and issue a ticket. For example, a space around a children's park serves as an AI fence. Anyone entering the space is notified they will be identified. Entry is forbidden if identification is not successful. Another example is a music venue that requires identification and a verifiable purchase to enter.

1. Mobile devices will support always-listening AI assistant.
2. Kids will carry always-on AI assistants that watch for dangerous situations and take action.
  - Parents will push this
3. Places will require you carry as phone.
  - You can't go into the children's park without a tracking device.
