## Create a permanent archive of your life

Create an archive such as a static website or Git repo that contains information about yourself such as voice samples, pictures, writing samples, historic information, etc.

## Increase fidelity 

For highest fidelity, include DNA samples, legal documents, brain scans, etc. The more detail you provide, the less interpolation needed.

## Strive for persistence

Use archiving services such as the Internet Archive to ensure your information is long retained after your physical death. Look for ways to persist your information for thousands of years.

## Set your terms

Create a page with your terms and conditions for being simulated.

## Advocate legal enforcement

Advocate for legal protections under the laws of your country.

## Improve discoverability

Cross-link with other archives.
