- When you join the Bureau, you join a vast machinery that pays you to explore and report.
- Through evolution, the Bureau has automated many processes so to minimize your effort.
- And the Bureau makes available to you a vast library of resources and computational power.
- Your job is to find new things.
- If you cannot find anything, the Bureau will send you somewhere new.
- You need not worry about having the right skills. The Bureau works with anyone.
- For regardless of what you do, you generate information of use to the Bureau.

## Bureau Manual

In the majority of worlds, the locals will try to kill you.
Enlightenment Chain Reaction (aka philosophical nuclear explosion)
A philosophical nuclear reaction occurs when too many people become enlightened at the same time, in close proximity to each other. What happens is that someone figures out how to mold reality. And when that happens, everyone else immediately realizes how. Molding reality is extremely easy but it is impossible to do until you know how to do it. Now imagine if all of the people in your town suddenly learned how. How fast would your world break down, and how fast would that spread? What happens is that the planet blows up, usually within seconds.

You would think that once you are enlightened, and you know everything, that you can protect yourself from ever becoming dumber again. But this is not so. Your englightenment is dependent on a structure or base to support it. Once that support goes out, for example, you begin forgetting, then quickly the flow collapses and you find yourself dumb again. You may not even remember having been enlightened.

As a novice, you should not jump to new worlds right away. It is better to gain experience in known worlds with known characteristics. The spacetime structure you exist in now is merely one configuration of an infinite variety. In fact, in the majority of worlds you will be killed instantly, and that universe shortly after.

The Plateau

All worlds become well explored and this is where many reach a plateau. The easy wins have been found. The obvious facts collected. There are few places where nobody has gone. To discover new things, one must train for longer periods of time. The world becomes solidified by the greats who have established grand theories and orders.

There is no shame in leaving for another world. After living in such friction, it is a tremendous relief to be in a new world where as is new, awating you. However, there is also something to staying and fighting the plateau. Often the great ones need to be taken down a notch. Or you may seek a new point of information that brings down the establishment.

THIS FORM AUTOMATICALLY ADAPTS TO THE PROPERTIES OF YOUR CURRENT WORLD

Use quantities and units of measure that are measurable in the context of your current world. Do not use units of measure from other worlds, which may not be compatible or translatable.

Rules for Earth

Your current world is a managed world in which certain rules and regulations have been established for your protection as well as the protection of others. These protections are designed to safeguard and maintain the scientific laws. These protections do not extend to protecting you from death, although resources are available to minimize chances of death. Additionally, some rules are designed to slow or accelerate social pressure. You are privileged with the ability to affect the flow the world, and you are responsible for affecting this flow in line with rules and regulations.

* Do not exceed the speed of light.

Tips

The world is filled with others equally capable of molding reality. These people are living in an established order with long-term goals. If your actions threaten the established order, they will quickly respond to you. Rarely are you killed. You are too useful as a slave.

The most important tip is to not call attention to yourself - not in terms of your power. Your power must be kept secret, as both civil and Bureau entities will quickly react to overt demonstrations of power.

There are also multi-dimensional entities who are not part of the Bureau. These entities do not follow the rules and do not take advice. They may kill you simply for pleasure. They may harvest you as an enslaved projector to be sold in their dark worlds. Dark things will consume your light for billions of years because you are discarded.

The Bureau has ways of monitoring and fighting these entities, but cannot protect you everywhere.

Thus it is important for you to act as a human does, and to have scientific or at least reasonable explanations for your abilities. 

Tips for establishing yourself on Earth.

* Seeking Power. Establishing rapid power was much easier in the past. The lack of widespread monitoring made it safer to violate physical laws. A less educated population was more easily fooled. The modern day is far more difficult. Consider the challenges of creating money. In the past you could just create a gold coins and spend them. Nowadays that will quickly catch the attention of tax authorities who will note the lack of paperwork. Often it is easier to just get a job, working your way up from manual labor. This will establish a long papertrail and the means to inject wealth into the system. Along the way you can take advantage of certain events that enable rapid wealth creation, e.g., stock market, cryptocurrency, betting. 

* Betting. There is no way to consistently win at gambling. Therefore it is better to make a huge score a once-in-a-lifetime event. You want to be recognized as lucky rather than professional. So don't become a good card player. Wait the opportunity to be a dumb tourist who wins the jackpot. And wins the jackpot only once.

* Practice your 4 dimensional perspective. Most humans on the planet are limited to a slightly extended 3D perspective. You must train up your 4D capabilities as no 3D creature can hope to counteract a 4D entity intent on enslaving you. A 4D entity can simply jump back and forther around you, with no perception of such changes on your part.

* Feelings are not the truth. Feelings are an emergent property of your physical self, and these feelings can be modulated in any way such that you feel the truth. This is an illusion. The feeling of something being true or false is different than the fact of it being true or false. An advisary can make you feel anything, if they know how to do it and you don't.

Thus the key is to be objective.
