title: "Young girl feeding baby"
caption: An old flier that was attached to a metal box and since torn and weathered heavily. The flier shows a young girl feeding a baby with a milk bottle. She is sitting on the ground with the baby in her lap. The picture implies poverty but the paper is so worn that no identification of the author or publisher is possible.
