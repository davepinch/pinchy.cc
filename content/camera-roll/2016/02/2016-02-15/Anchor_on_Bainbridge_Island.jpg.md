anchor of: Bainbridge Island
description: "A large reddish-brown anchor near the ferry terminal on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The anchor is resting on the edge of a ravine, overlooking the Winslow Ravine Creek as it winds through mud to Eagle Harbor. The earth around the anchor is tan with many small rocks, held together with patches of grass and vegetation. Everything is wet from the rain."
