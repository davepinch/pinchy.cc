  - "One night in 2013, founding Grateful Dead guitarist Bob Weir was playing a set with his RatDog quartet at the Sweetwater Music Hall in Mill Valley, California when a group of patrons wouldn’t quiet down. Weir took the opportunity—mid-solo—to not-so-politely ask the group to keep it down. Except that’s not the phrase he used!"
  - SHUT UP AND LISTEN
