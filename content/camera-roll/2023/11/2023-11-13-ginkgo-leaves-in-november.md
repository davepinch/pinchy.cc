  The leaves are unique among seed plants, being fan-shaped with veins radiating out into the leaf blade, sometimes bifurcating (splitting), but never anastomosing to form a network.

It is autumn and the ground is covered with the brown and yellow leaves of the Ginkgo biloba tree. The leaves of a Ginkgo tree are uniquely shaped as a fan. They have the feeling of coming from a different world. This is not far from the truth, for the Ginkgo is a so-called "living fossil": a species that has existed for millions of years.
