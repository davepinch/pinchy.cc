description: >-
  The maze of logging roads in Marckworth State Forest are progressively more primitive deeper in the forest. This is a side road of a side road, which has become hardly more than a trail. A tree has fallen, blocking the path. Ahead is a clearing, inviting you to climb through and explore. To get here: The main road on the north side of the Marckworth forest is 299 Avenue SE (sometimes labeled on maps as Cedar Ponds Road or Potson Road). On that road is a gate with the label DNR 1021, leading to a dirt road. If you walk up that road, you will find this more primitive side branch leading to a clearcut.
