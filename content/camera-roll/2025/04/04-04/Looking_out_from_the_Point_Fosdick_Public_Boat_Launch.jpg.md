  This picture of the Wollochet Bay was taken at the Point Fosdick Public Boat Launch in Wollochet, Washington. The boat ramp faces approximately southwest toward the southern boundary of Wollochet Bay where it opens into the larger Hale Passage. The landmass to the left is Fox Island in the Hale Passage. The landmass to the right is Artondale, Washington across the Wollochet Bay. The boat ramp is sandy and said to cause friction issues.
