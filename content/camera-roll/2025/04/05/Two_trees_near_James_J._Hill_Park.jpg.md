  Two trees along the sidewalk near James J. Hill Park in Everett, Washington. I had stepped away from the "Hands Off" protest occurring throughout the United States on that day. In Everett, the protest had started earlier in the day at the Snohomish County Courthouse, after speeches, we walked down to Broadway Avenue to spread around with our signs. I noticed an interesting bridge on Broadway & Hewitt Avenue and decided to take a peek. There I found James J. Hill Park, a very small park next to railroad tracks. This picture was taken on the sidewalk next to the park, facing east down Hewitt.
