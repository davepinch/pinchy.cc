  A protected area near the exit of the Kenmore Boat Launch. At the time I was walking out of the parking lot to check a nearby neighborhood. I was irritated by a person walking near me with his unleashed dog, although the dog did behave. This area is protected by a chain-link fence, so I grabbed a quick picture through the chains and headed out.
