  A view of the parking lot at the Kenmore Boat Launch, also known as the Lake Washington North Boat Ramp. The boat launch is actually on the Sammamish River shortly upstream from Lake Washington. On foot, it can be reached from nearby Rhododendron Park. I had been exploring the park and found this view of multiple angles to be interesting.
