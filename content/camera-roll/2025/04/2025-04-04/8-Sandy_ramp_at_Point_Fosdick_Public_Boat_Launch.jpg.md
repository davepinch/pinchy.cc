  Looking down the boat ramp at Point Fosdick Public Boat Launch. The ramp faces approximately west and enters the Wollochet Bay. A sign warns the visitor that the ramp is not maintained past a certain point. According to the Pierce County website as of April 2025, the behavior of the tide causes sand to accumulate on the ramp, which can then cause traction issues. The issue seems evident in this picture.
