description: "On the road under the light rail at the Lynnwood City Center. This is a good endpoint if you are taking a short stroll along the Scriber Creek Trail from Scriber Creek Park. At the time of this picture, the sun was bright and hot, and I stood in the shade of the light rail line, high above me."
