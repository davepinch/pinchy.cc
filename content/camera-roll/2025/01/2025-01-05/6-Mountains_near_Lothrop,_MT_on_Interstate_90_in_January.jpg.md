  A view of the mountains near Lothrop, Montana on Interstate 90 in January 2025. It is late afternoon and getting darker. Snow covers the ground. The sky is overcast with some low-hanging clouds in the valleys. This picture was taken from Adams Street off the Petty Creek Road exit of Interstate 90. Lothrop is the small settlement at the base of the mountains, visible to the right. Not visible is the Clark Fork River between the highway and mountains. The mountains are part of Lolo National Forest in the Bitterroot Range, a subrange of the Rocky Mountains.

note: This is the second variation of this picture, originally titled *Mountains near Alberton on Interstate 90 in January*. When moving the picture to Wikimedia on 7/1/2025, I decided I liked this version better and uploaded it to Wikimedia, replacing the old version. I did not upload the old version to Wikimedia in order to avoid too close of a duplicate. The old version can be found through the Internet Archive.
