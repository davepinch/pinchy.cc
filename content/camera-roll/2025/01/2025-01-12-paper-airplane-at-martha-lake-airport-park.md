title: "Paper airplane at Martha Lake Airport Park"

description: >-
  After parking, I notice some metallic sculptures along the west side of the park. These seem to be various forms of paper airplanes. An older man was walking by and I felt a bit awkward grabbing a picture, so I wanted for him to pass. I then looked around to find the glacial erratic that is supposed to be in the park. I see it in the distance.
