title: "Clearing north of Martha Lake Airport Park"
author: David Pinch
clearing to the north of: Martha Lake Airport Park
description: >-
  Across the street from Martha Lake Airport Park. I'm unclear if this is a segment of the park, or undeveloped land. It seems like something was once here and removed. The land is flat with gravel and moss.
