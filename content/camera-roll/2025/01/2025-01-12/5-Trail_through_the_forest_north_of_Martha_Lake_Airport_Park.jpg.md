description: "A dirt trail winds through a forested area adjacent to Martha Lake Airport Park in Washington. The trail appears quiet and undisturbed, with no visible signs, people, or animals. Along the path are tall, leafless trees with a mix of green vegetation and brown underbrush. A cloudy sky is visible through the bare branches."
