clearing to the north of: Martha Lake Airport Park
description: "A clearing in the woods across the street from Martha Lake Airport Park. I'm unclear if this is a segment of the park, or undeveloped land. Something was once here and has since been removed. The land is flat with gravel and moss. On the other side of the clearing is a mound and the edge of the woods. The trees are thin and without leaves. A trail goes across the clearing to the woods."
