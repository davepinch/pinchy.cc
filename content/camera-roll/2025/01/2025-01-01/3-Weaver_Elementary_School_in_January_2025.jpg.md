  Exterior view of Madeline L. Weaver Elementary School in Maplewood, Minnesota, taken on January 1, 2025. The image shows the front facade of the school building with its name visible in raised letters on the brick wall. Despite being mid-winter, the ground is free of snow, with dormant grass and bare trees indicating the season. The absence of snow is notable for this time of year in Minnesota. *Description written by ChatGPT (GPT-4)*
