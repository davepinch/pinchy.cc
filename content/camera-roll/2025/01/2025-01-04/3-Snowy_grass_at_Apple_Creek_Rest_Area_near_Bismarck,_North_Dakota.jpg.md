description: >-
  I stopped by the Apple Creek Rest Area in North Dakota on the evening of January 4, 2025. It was getting dark as I had already driven most of the day from the Twin Cities in Minnesota. I took a picture of the grass so I would have some record of North Dakota, as the darkness prevented me from capturing the North Dakota landscape.
