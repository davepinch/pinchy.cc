abandoned sign of: Martha Lake, Washington
author: David Pinch
description: "This abandoned sign is at the corner of Bothell-Everett Highway and 183rd Street Southeast on the eastern edge of Martha Lake, Washington. It occurred to me that few people will remember this sign as it is not particularly notable. I have driven by this sign many times and I don't remember noticing it. Perhaps the person who sprayed Chief on the sign will remember it. I took this picture on a rare sunny day in Washington, immediately after leaving the North Creek County Park."
