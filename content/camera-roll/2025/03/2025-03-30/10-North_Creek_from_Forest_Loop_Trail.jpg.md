description: "This is from the bridge on Forest Loop Trail in McCollumn Pioneer Park. At the time there were people on the other side of the bridge (on the upstream direction). I was self-conscious of the camera clicking sound, so I quickly left without spending time framing a picture. I will have to return to this spot and explore more."
