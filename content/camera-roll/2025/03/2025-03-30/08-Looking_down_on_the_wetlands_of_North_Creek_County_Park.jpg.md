description: "Looking down from a side branch of the floating boardwalk in North Creek County Park (part of the larger North Creek Trail system). There are plants and moss on a clump of earth, surrounded by water. At the time, it was a rare sunny day in Washington, reflected by the water surrounding the plants."
