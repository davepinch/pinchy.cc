description: "Entering the North Creek County Park from the parking lot on the south side of the park. The boardwalk is reached by veering right past the buildings ahead. This picture was made on a sunny day, a rarity at this time of the year in the Pacific Northwest. As such the parking lot was filling up quickly."
