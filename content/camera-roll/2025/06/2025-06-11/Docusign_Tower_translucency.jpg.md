  This picture was taken in front of the Henry M. Jackson Federal Building on 2nd Avenue in Seattle, from the street. A similar view can be replicated with the street view modes of popular mapping services. At the time of this photo, a protest march had deposited protesters in front of the federal building for protesting later in the evening. The tall, seemingly translucent, building on the far right is Docusign Tower, formerly known as Wells Fargo Center. The tall black building in the middle is Safeco Plaza. The tall building to the far left is 1000 Second Avenue. Tucked behind this building, with just a sliver visible, is 1111 Third Avenue. The glass building in the far distance is Rainier Square Tower. At the bottom, with just a few top floors visible, is a building with an unknown name at approximately 1015 3rd Avenue.
