  An anti-ICE emergency protest was held in Seattle on June 11, 2025. Protesters marched from Cal Anderson Park in Capitol Hill to the Henry M. Jackson Federal Building in downtown Seattle. This picture was taken from 2nd avenue with the bus stop and federal building to the left. At this point the march was finished, and people were preparing to continue the protest more directly.
