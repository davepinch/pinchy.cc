description: "Walking along the West Trail in Farrell's Marsh Wildlife Area, near an opening to the marsh. The picture has multiple layers of green representing different vegetation in the marsh. Nearby is vegetation along the shore. Across the marsh is a layer of cattails, and beyond that a row of conifer trees. The sky is blue and reflects on the water."
