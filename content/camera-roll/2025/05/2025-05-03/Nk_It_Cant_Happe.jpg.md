cop city of: Atlanta
description: >-
  Found along Woodinville Drive (SR 522) in Bothell, Washington. The sticker seems to have a warning about Cop City but the message has been obscured because people are scraping the sticker off. Presumably the city would do a better job removing the sticker, so it may be local residents reacting to the message. Note that Cop City is a law enforcement training facility near Atlantia, Georgia.
