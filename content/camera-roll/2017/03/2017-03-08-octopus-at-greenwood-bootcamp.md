Picture imported on February 1, 2024 - and I had no idea what I was doing in Greenwood on March 8, 2017 (based on the GPS coordinates in the picture metadata). Streetside view in Bing Maps wasn't any help, but I found an old email chain about the Greenwood Tenant Rights Bootcamp on that night. I believe the picture is from the inside of Makeda & Mingus coffeeshop, which hosted the event.
