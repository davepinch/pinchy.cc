title: "Sunrise on Downtown Seattle"
actually this is sunset:
  - I was looking at this picture one day and realized it could not sunrise.
  - This picture is looking roughly south toward downtown Seattle.
  - The light is coming from the right (west).
  - The sun rises in the east and sets in the west (nothern hemisphere).
  - Hence this must be sunset.
