description: "A picture of Mill Creek Lake (also known as Bennington Lake) outside Walla Walla, Washington. I took this picture after attending the 2015 Gentleman of the Road festival. My partner and I make friends with our camping neighbors, and after the event we decided to find a place to swim. We found this place on a map, but it was not suitable for swimming. The beach was muddy and covered in bird droppings. The area was nice, however. The picture shows the brown and green shrubs around the lake, with smooth water and rolling hills in the distance. The sky is clear."
note: This lake is better known as Bennington Lake. It is still listed as Mill Creek Lake on online maps as of August 2024.
