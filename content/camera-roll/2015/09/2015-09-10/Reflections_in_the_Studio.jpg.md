caption: "This looks like a hallway but it is an illusion. Half of the picture is a glass wall that reflects the other side."
description: "A picture of the hallway in Studio A on the Redmond Microsoft Campus. At the time there was a glass wall which became reflective when viewed at a high angle. Standing close to the wall creates a mirror reflection of the windows along the hallway. At the time the audio and speech team of Windows 10 and HoloLens worked out of this area."
