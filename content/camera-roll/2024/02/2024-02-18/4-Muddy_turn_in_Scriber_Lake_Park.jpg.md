description: >-
  A picture of a path making a right-hand turn in Scriber Lake Park, Lynnwood, Washington. The path is a bit distinct from the typical Washington trail. It is muddy but has groomed sides made with wooden borders. The left side is bordered by a short green plant that uniformly covers the grounds. The right side is bordered by grass that transitions into the same green plant as the left side. This is February so the sky is overcast and gray. The larger plants around the trail are gray and brown brushes with little green.
