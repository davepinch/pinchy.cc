description: "A picture taken from a dock on Scriber Lake in Lynnwood, Washington. The dock is part of the trail system of Scriber Lake Park. The water surface is smooth with some ripples, reflecting a mirror image of trees on the other side. The trees are in two rows - along the shoreline is a row of leafless trees, and behind them is a row of conifers. The sky is gray and overcast."
