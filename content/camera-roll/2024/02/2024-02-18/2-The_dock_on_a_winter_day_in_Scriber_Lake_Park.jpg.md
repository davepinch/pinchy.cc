description: "Walking along the trail system and dock of Scriber Lake Park in Lynnwood, Washington. It is a winter day in February, which for Lynnwood means gray overcast skies, leafless trees, and a general lack of green except for conifer trees. This picture looks down the dock as it extends into Scriber Lake. The dock is made of wood with wooden fences along the sides. Brown cattails are flush against the dock."
