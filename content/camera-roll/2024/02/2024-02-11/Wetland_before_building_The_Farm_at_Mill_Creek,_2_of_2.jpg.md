description: "*The Farm at Mill Creek* is a project in Mill Creek, Washington to develop a site for commercial and residential use. I came across this land and took a picture before construction. The picture shows surface water surrounded by the brown vegetation of winter. Nearby is a decaying log. In the distance are houses and a road marking the boundary of the wetland. The sky is cloudy and dark, as evening is coming."
