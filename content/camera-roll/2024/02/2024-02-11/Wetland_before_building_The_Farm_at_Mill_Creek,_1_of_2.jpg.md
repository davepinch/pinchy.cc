description: >-
  *The Farm at Mill Creek* is a project in Mill Creek, Washington to develop a site for commercial and residential use. I came across this land and took a picture before construction. The picture shows mostly grasses along with patches of different vegetation. There are several logs from fallen trees, along with a cut tree trunk. The top of a drain is visible. The sky is cloudy as nighttime is coming.
