description: "Looking at the still water of a side channel of the Skykomish River. The top of the picture shows a reflection of trees located across the channel. These trees are tall and thin. The bottom of the picture shows a shadow of the trees located behind the camera. These shadows reveal the rocky bed of the channel. A few scatted yellow leaves float around."
