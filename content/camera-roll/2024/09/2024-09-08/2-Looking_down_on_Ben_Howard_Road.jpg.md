description: "Along Ben Howard Road at a pullover near the Skykomish River, I looked down and found the edge of the road to be interesting. The left side of the picture shows thick and green grass. The grass borders a layer of accumulated leaves. The leaves are adjacent to the pebbles that make up the shoulder of Ben Howard."
