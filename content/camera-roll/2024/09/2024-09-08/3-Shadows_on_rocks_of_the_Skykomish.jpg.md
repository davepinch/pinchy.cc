description: "To me, this picture becomes more interesting after a while. At first it is a picture of light and shadows against rocks on the Skykomish River. As I look the contrast seems to change as if the rocks are painted. The picture was taken under trees on a sunny day. This part of the Skykomish shore contains many small rocks that have been worn over the years."
