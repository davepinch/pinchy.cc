description: >-
  An example of glacial till along Sharpe Cove on Fidalgo Island. Sharpe Cove is part of the larger Bowman Bay near Rosario Beach (famous for agates). The shoreline of Sharpe Cove has numerous examples of till. Mary and I visited this site after spending the morning looking for agates on Rosario Beach.
