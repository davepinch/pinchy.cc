description: "A winter day in Stillwater, Minnesota as fog covers the area. The camera is facing the prominent gazebo in North Lowell Park that overlooks the Saint Croix River. A light snow has covered the ground, with footprints visible. The river is not entirely frozen and has patches of open water. In the distance the bluffs of Wisconsin are barely visible, obscured by the fog."
