description: "A fallen tree in the woods near the Little Family Cemetery. It is Christmas Day 2024 and the sky is blue with some whisps of clouds. The trees are bare, and the ground is brown. This large tree has collapsed in the woods. I wonder about its age and whether it was ever seen by the family when it was young."
