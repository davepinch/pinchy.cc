description: >-
  A rare December day with sunlight in Bothell West, Snohomish County, Washington. This picture was taken from 201st Street SE looking north on Filbert Drive and the parallel North Creek Trail. The picture shows part of a large green conifer and green grass, with patches of blue sky, and could easily be mistaken for spring. Some residential homes are visible. Shadows from the sunlight are on the street.
