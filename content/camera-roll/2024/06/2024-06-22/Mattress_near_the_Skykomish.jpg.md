  We decided to explore into the woods because I had seen references to a quarry on an old map. The woods seem to be above a depression in the ground. Along the way we came across this matress.
description: "A discarded mattress laying on fallen trees in the proposed Steelhead County Park outside of Sultan River (across the Skykomish River). It is a June day so the forest floor is green with scattered flowers. The mattress is old and shredded, with accumulated leaves on it."

note: This picture was originally titled *Matress near the Skykomish*, which spells mattress incorrectly. In July 2025 I moved the picture to Wikimedia Commons and corrected the spelling. I am retaining the original URL to avoid breaking links.
