  Mary waited in the car while I did some quick scouting for rock hounding locations. The park was too crowded for us to enjoy. At the beach there is a series of underwater pylons.
description: "Old wooden pilings extend into Puget Sound from the shore at Picnic Point Park in Snohomish County, Washington. The view faces southwest across the water toward the Kitsap Peninsula, with the Olympic Mountains visible in the far distance. On the far left, the shoreline near Edmonds is visible."

TODO:
  - When redirects are implemented, change to a standard URL for Wikimedia-hosted pictures.
  - Identify the source of the pylons, e.g., a former dock.
