description: "Looking across the Pilchuck River at a large graffiti tag from INSITE. This picture was taken from Pilchuck Park and is facing upstream toward the 92nd Street SE bridge in Snohomish, Washington. On this day the sky was blue with some wispy clouds. The water level has some shallow rapids on a turn of the river. INSITE is painted on a cement structure parallel with the water."
