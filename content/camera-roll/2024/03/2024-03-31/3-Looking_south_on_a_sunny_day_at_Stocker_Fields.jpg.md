description: "Looking over large open space that was made for soccer fields. The land is flat and bright green, with the horizon nearly adjacent to a blue sky with wispy clouds. The lines for the soccer fields are not drawn, but the flatness gives a hint of its purpose. This picture was taken near the baseball field, standing on a cement structure looking southward."
