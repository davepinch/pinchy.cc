  A large piece of metal covering construction on the sidewalk. The metal was painted bright yellow but has been heavily worn causing an interesting mix of yellow and black splotches. A red leaf on the board provides some color contrast.

A colorful piece of construction covering the [sidewalk](/sidewalk/) in the High Point neighborhood of [West Seattle](/west-seattle/). At the time I was canvassing for a political candidate and it was my first time in the neighborhood.
