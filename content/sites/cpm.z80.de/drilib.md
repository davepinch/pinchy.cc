documentation of:
  - CP/M
  - CP/M-86
excerpt: >-
  Here, in one place, are all the manuals we have for Digital Research software products. These manuals have been produced by scanning, and ocr'ing, the originals. Where possible, the look and feel of the original has been preserved as much as possible. The manuals presented here have been through an extensive clean-up process. OCR is not an exact art, at least not in the affordable software available for the PC, so a separate cleanup process is necessary to produce a pretty manual.
