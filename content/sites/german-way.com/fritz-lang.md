biography of: Fritz Lang
excerpt: >-
  The man born Friedrich Christian Anton Lang in Vienna on 5 December 1890 claimed to have studied art and architecture in Vienna, Munich, and Paris. But according to biographer Patrick McGilligan (Fritz Lang: The Nature of the Beast), this was just one of several Fritz Lang legends that the director carefully cultivated over the years. In reality, Lang dropped out of Viennaâ€™s Technische Hochschule (technical college) after only two years.
