excerpt: >-
  86-DOS provides the tools needed to develop programs for the 8086, as well as a hardware-independent environment in which to run these programs. It is a very modular system. At its core is the disk file manager and I/O device handler, and everything else is considered a "user program". This allows the system to be easily trailored to any custom requirements.
