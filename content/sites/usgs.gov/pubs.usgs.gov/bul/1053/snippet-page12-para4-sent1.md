title: "The Mcintosh formation was named and described by Snavely, Ran, Hoover, and Roberts (1951) from beds that are well exposed in road cuts along State Route 5H on the south side of Mcintosh Lake."
naming of: McIntosh Formation
note:
 - State Route 5H was later renamed to State Route 507
 - A lot of time has passed since this report was published. Today there does not seem to be very obvious roadcuts on the south side of McIntosh Lake based on street view maps. There are some spots that may be the exposed formation (hard to tell), e.g., [here](https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=1165af75-b36f-4e9b-8ddd-4007e98d645b&cp=46.866125~-122.763384&lvl=14.632178&dir=156.40219&pi=-15.334425&style=x&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027).
