excerpt: >-
  Gamma Andromedae is a rather interesting double star within our own Milky Way galaxy. First, the primary is a very yellow star, and the secondary an intense blue. At over 350 light years distance, the light from these stars reaching us today left not long after Christian Huygens proposed that Saturn had rings... in the 1600's! But the star gets even stranger. The dimmer blue secondary is itself a double star, averaging a Sun/Neptune distance. Stranger still, the primary of THAT system is ALSO double! So Gamma Andromedae is really a quadruple star system.
