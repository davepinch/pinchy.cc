  Lake Phalen is named for Phalen Creek that flows out the south end of the lake. Edward Phalen (or Phelan) was a former soldier that settled along a creek that flowed between Phalen Lake and the Mississippi River. In 1838, he was discharged from Fort Snelling. He took a series of claims around St. Paul and lived in a cabin about a mile away from the other settlers.
