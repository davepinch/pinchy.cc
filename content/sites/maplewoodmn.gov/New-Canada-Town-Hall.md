excerpt: >-
  The abandoned building at 1375 Frost Avenue is probably the oldest building in Maplewood. It was constructed in 1879 near the north end of Lake Phalen "to hold elections and transact all business connected with the town" (New Canada Township). The town government was led by three supervisors who were elected every year and most of the business in early years was to create and maintain roads and bridges. As the population grew, a more central location was needed and the building was moved to the south side of Frost Avenue in 1900.
