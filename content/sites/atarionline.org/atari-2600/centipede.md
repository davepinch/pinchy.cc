title: "Centipede (Atari 2600) online game (atarionline.org)"
excerpt: >-
  In Atari 2600 Centipede, the main objective is to shoot all the segments of a centipede as it winds its way down the playing field. The centipede moves horizontally across the screen, and when it hits a mushroom or the edge of the screen, it drops down one row and changes direction. The player controls a small bug blaster at the bottom of the screen, firing shots at the centipede and other enemies such as spiders, scorpions, and fleas. (Millipede, released in 1982, is the arcade sequel to Centipede. It features more gameplay variety and a wider array of insects than the original game.)
