title: "Interesting BiCMOS circuits in the Pentium, reverse-engineered (righto.com)"
author: Ken Shirriff
bicmos of: Pentium
excerpt: >-
  Intel released the powerful Pentium processor in 1993, establishing a long-running brand of processors. Earlier, I wrote about the ROM in the Pentium's floating point unit that holds constants such as Ï€. In this post, I'll look at some interesting circuits associated with this ROM. In particular, the circuitry is implemented in BiCMOS, a process that combines bipolar transistors with standard CMOS logic.
