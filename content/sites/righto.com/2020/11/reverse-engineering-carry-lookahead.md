title: "Reverse-engineering the carry-lookahead circuit in the Intel 8008 processor (righto.com)"
author: Ken Shirriff
carry-lookahead circuit of: Intel 8008
excerpt: >-
  The 8008 was Intel's first 8-bit microprocessor, introduced in 1972. While primitive by today's standards, the 8008 is historically important because it essentially started the microprocessor revolution and is the ancestor of the modern x86 processor family. I've been studying the 8008's silicon die under the microscope and reverse-engineering its circuitry.
