title: "Reverse engineering ARM1 instruction sequencing, compared with the Z-80 and 6502 (righto.com)"
author: Ken Shirriff
excerpt: >-
  When a computer executes a machine language instruction, it breaks down the instruction into smaller steps that are performed in sequence. For instance, a load instruction might first compute a memory address, then fetch a value from that address, and then store that value in a register. This article describes how the ARM1 processor implements instruction sequencing, performing the right steps in order. I also look briefly at the 6502 and Z-80 microprocessors and the different sequencing techniques they use.
instruction sequencing of:
  - ARM1
  - MOS Technology 6502
  - Zilog Z80
