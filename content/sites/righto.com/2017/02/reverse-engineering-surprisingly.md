title: "Reverse-engineering the surprisingly advanced ALU of the 8008 microprocessor (righto.com)"
arithmetic-logic unit of: Intel 8008
author: Ken Shirriff
excerpt: >-
  A computer's arithmetic-logic unit (ALU) is the heart of the processor, performing arithmetic and logic operations on data. If you've studied digital logic, you've probably learned how to combine simple binary adder circuits to build an ALU. However, the 8008's ALU uses clever logic circuits that can perform multiple operations efficiently. And unlike most 1970's microprocessors, the 8008 uses a complex carry-lookahead circuit to increase its performance.
