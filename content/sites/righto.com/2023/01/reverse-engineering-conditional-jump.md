title: "Reverse-engineering the conditional jump circuitry in the 8086 processor (righto.com)"
author: Ken Shirriff
conditional jump circuitry of: Intel 8086
excerpt: >-
  Intel introduced the 8086 microprocessor in 1978 and it had a huge influence on computing. I'm reverse-engineering the 8086 by examining the circuitry on its silicon die and in this blog post I take a look at how conditional jumps are implemented. Conditional jumps are an important part of any instruction set, changing the flow of execution based on a condition. Although this instruction may seem simple, it involves many parts of the CPU: the 8086 uses microcode along with special-purpose condition logic.
