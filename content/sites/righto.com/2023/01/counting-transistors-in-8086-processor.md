counting transistors of: Intel 8086
excerpt: >-
  How many transistors are in Intel's 8086 processor? This seems like a straightforward question, but it doesn't have a straightforward answer. Most sources say that this processor has 29,000 transistors.1 However, I have traced out every transistor from die photos and my count is 19,618. What accounts for the 9382 missing transistors?
