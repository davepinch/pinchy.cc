title: "Reverse-engineering the Intel 8086 processor's HALT circuits (righto.com)"
author: Ken Shirriff
excerpt: >-
  The 8086 processor was introduced in 1978 and has greatly influenced modern computing through the x86 architecture. One unusual instruction in this processor is HLT, which stops the processor and puts it in a halt state. In this blog post, I explain in detail how the halt circuitry is implemented and how it interacts with the 8086's architecture.
