division microcode of: Intel 8086
excerpt: >-
  While programmers today take division for granted, most microprocessors in the 1970s could only add and subtract â€” division required a slow and tedious loop implemented in assembly code. One of the nice features of the Intel 8086 processor (1978) was that it provided machine instructions for integer multiplication and division. Internally, the 8086 still performed a loop, but the loop was implemented in microcode: faster and transparent to the programmer. Even so, division was a slow operation, about 50 times slower than addition.
