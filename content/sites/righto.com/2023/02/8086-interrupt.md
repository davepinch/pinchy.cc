title: "Reverse-engineering the interrupt circuitry in the Intel 8086 processor (righto.com)"
author: Ken Shirriff
excerpt: >-
  Interrupts have been an important part of computers since the mid-1950s, providing a mechanism to interrupt a program's execution. Interrupts allows the computer to handle time-critical tasks such as I/O device operations. In this blog post, I look at the interrupt features in the Intel 8086 (1978) and how they are implemented in silicon, a combination of interesting circuitry and microcode.
