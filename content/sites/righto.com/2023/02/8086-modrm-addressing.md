title: "Reverse-engineering the ModR/M addressing microcode in the Intel 8086 processor (righto.com)"
author: Ken Shirriff
excerpt: >-
  One interesting aspect of a computer's instruction set is its addressing modes, how the computer determines the address for a memory access. The Intel 8086 (1978) used the ModR/M byte, a special byte following the opcode, to select the addressing mode.1 The ModR/M byte has persisted into the modern x86 architecture, so it's interesting to look at its roots and original implementation.
