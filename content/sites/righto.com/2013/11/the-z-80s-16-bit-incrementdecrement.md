title: "The Z-80's 16-bit increment/decrement circuit reverse engineered (righto.com)"
excerpt: >-
  The 8-bit Z-80 processor was very popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s, powering many personal computers such as the Osborne 1, TRS-80, and Sinclair ZX Spectrum. It has a 16-bit incrementer/decrementer that efficiently updates the program counter and stack pointer, as well as supporting several 16-bit instructions and memory refresh. By reverse engineering detailed die photographs of the Z-80, we can see exactly how this increment/decrement circuit works and discover the interesting optimizations it uses for efficiency.
