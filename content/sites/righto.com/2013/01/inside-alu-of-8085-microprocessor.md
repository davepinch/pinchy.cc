title: "Inside the ALU of the 8085 microprocessor (righto.com)"
arithmetic-logic unit of: Intel 8085
author: Ken Shirriff
excerpt: >-
  The arithmetic-logic unit is a fundamental part of any computer, performing addition, subtraction, and logic operations, but how it works is a mystery to many people. I've reverse-engineered the ALU circuit from the 8085 microprocessor and explain how it works. The 8085's ALU is a surprisingly complex circuit that at first looks like a mysterious jumble of gates, but it can be understood if you don't mind diving into some Boolean logic.
