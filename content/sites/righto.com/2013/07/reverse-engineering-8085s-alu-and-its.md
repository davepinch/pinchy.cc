title: "Reverse-engineering the 8085's ALU and its hidden registers (righto.com)"
alu of: Intel 8085
author: Ken Shirriff
excerpt: >-
  This article describes how the ALU of the 8085 microprocessor works and how it interacts with the rest of the chip, based on reverse-engineering of the silicon. (This is part 2 of my ALU reverse-engineering; part 1 described the circuit for a single ALU bit.) Along with the accumulator, the ALU uses two undocumented registers - ACT and TMP - and this article describes how they work in detail, as well as how the ALU is controlled.
