title: "Reverse-engineering the flag circuits in the 8085 processor (righto.com)"
author: Ken Shirriff
excerpt: >-
  Processors all have status flags to keep track of conditions such as a zero value, a carry, or a negative value. Whenever you write a loop or conditional, these flags ultimately are in control. But how are these flags implemented in the chip's silicon? I've reverse-engineered the flag circuits in the 8085 microprocessor and explain what is really going on.
