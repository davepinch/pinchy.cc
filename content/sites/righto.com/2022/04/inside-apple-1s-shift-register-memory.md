excerpt: >-
  Apple's first product was the Apple-1 computer, introduced exactly 46 years ago, on April 11, 1976. This early microcomputer used an unusual type of storage for its display: shift register memory. Instead of storing data in RAM (random-access memory), it was stored in a 1024-position shift register. You put a bit into the shift register and 1024 clock cycles later, the bit pops out the other end. In the early days of random-access memory chips, shift-register memory was cheaper so many systems used it. The downside, of course, is that you had to use bits as they became available, rather than access arbitrary memory locations.
