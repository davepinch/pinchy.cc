  ALNITAK (Zeta Orionis). With brilliant Betelgeuse and Rigel dominating great Orion, we pay little heed to the individual stars of the Hunter's belt except as a group, the trio the Arabs called the "string of pearls." All second magnitude, Johannes Bayer seems to have named the stars Delta, Epsilon, and Zeta from right to left.
