excerpt: >-
  Perseus (the Hero) may be the champion not only of Andromeda but also of unnamed stars as well. The top two, Mirfak (Alpha) and Algol (Beta) have proper names, and then the list stops until we arrive at number 10, a fourth magnitude star called "Atik" and Bayer's "Omicron" star. Fainter yet is number 12 in brightness, mid-fourth magnitude Menkib (Bayer's "Xi").
