excerpt: >-
  IOTA-1 SCO (Iota-1 Scorpii). Supergiants are rare, and to find two of them within a quarter-degree of each other is rarer still. To find two forms of supergiants that for the class are rare in themselves draws the eye, or at least should. Nevertheless, these two magnificent stars, which have no proper names and are known as Iota-1 (the western and brighter) and Iota-2 Scorpii, are quite neglected, perhaps by contrast to Scorpius's brighter magnificent stars, which include one of the most prominent of all supergiants, Antares.
note: This star is also known as Apollyon according to Wikipedia but the origin of the name is unknown (TODO).
