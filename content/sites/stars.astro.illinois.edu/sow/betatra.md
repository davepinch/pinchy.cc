excerpt: >-
  BETA TRA (Beta Trianguli Australis). While not a dramatic star, third magnitude (2.85) Beta TrA, the number two star of Triangulum Australe, the Southern Triangle, is still so bright -- well in the top 150 -- that it surely deserves recognition, especially since TrA itself is a nice, bright constellation.
