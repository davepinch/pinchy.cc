excerpt: >-
  CEBALRAI (Beta Ophiuchi). At the northern tip of Ophiuchus, the Serpent Bearer, lies Rasalhague, the bright Alpha star. Helping to form the huge rough pentagon that makes the classic figure is Cebalrai, at the pentagon's northeastern corner, its position and bright third magnitude status (2.77) causing Bayer to call it "Beta."
