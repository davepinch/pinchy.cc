excerpt: >-
  DELTA CEP (Delta Cephei). Surely among the most famed of all stars, fourth magnitude (4.1 or thereabouts) Delta Cephei, set at the southeastern corner of dim Cepheus (the King), does not even have a proper name. It is, however, the only star that has given its constellation name over to represent a whole class of stars, the "Cepheids."
