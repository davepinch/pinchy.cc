  RIGIL KENTAURUS (Alpha Centauri) with PROXIMA CENTAURI (Alpha Cen C). Among the most famed stars of the entire sky, surely rival in renown to Sirius and Polaris even though not visible to much of the world's population, is the "foot of the Centaur," Rigil Kentaurus, "Rigil Kent," the first star of Centaurus, probably much better known as Alpha Centauri or just Alpha Cen.
