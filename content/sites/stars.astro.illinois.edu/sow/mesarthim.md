excerpt: >-
  MESARTHIM (Gamma Arietis). Shining third among the stars of the flat triangle that make the classical figure of Aries, the Ram (for that reason gaining the Gamma designation), Mesarthim actually takes fourth place in the constellation after non-named 41 Arietis, which glows softly off to the northeast.
