excerpt: >-
  EPSILON SCO (Epsilon Scorpii). Though bright, second magnitude (2.29), in most other constellations Epsilon Sco would have a prominent place and probably a proper name. Here, in one of the grandest patterns of the sky, Scorpius, it has neither.
note: Epsilon Scorpii was officially named Larawag after publication of this page.
