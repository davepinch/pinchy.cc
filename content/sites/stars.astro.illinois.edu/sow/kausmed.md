excerpt: >-
  At the bow's northern end lies Kaus Borealis, at the southern Kaus Australis, and in the middle and marking the eastern end of the arrow Kaus Media, the names an odd mixture of languages, Kaus coming from an Arabic word meaning "bow," while the other three words respectively mean, from Latin, "northern," "southern," and "middle."
