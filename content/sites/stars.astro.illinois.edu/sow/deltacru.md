excerpt: >-
  DELTA CRU (Delta Crucis). Overwhelmed by its neighbors in Crux, one of the most famous constellations of the sky, and fourth brightest in the 4-star pattern, Delta Crucis is the only one with no proper name (though given that Alpha Crucis is called "Acrux" and Gamma Crucis "Gacrux," no one would likely object to "Delcrux.")
note: Delta Crucis was assigned the name Imai in 2018 by the IAU, after the publication of this page.
