excerpt: >-
  AL TARF (Beta Cancri). Surely, if Cancer (the Crab) were anywhere but on the ecliptic, the apparent pathway of the Sun, it never would have been made into a constellation by the ancients. Its brightest star, Al Tarf, is fourth magnitude, though in its favor (at 3.59) it is just over the line from third.
