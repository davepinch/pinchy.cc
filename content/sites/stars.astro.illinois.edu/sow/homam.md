  HOMAM (Zeta Pegasi). The name really belongs to a pair of stars, Zeta and Xi Pegasi (in Pegasus, the Flying Horse), which together to the ancient Arabs became known (translated from an obscure phrase) as the "lucky stars of the hero," presumably of the hero Perseus. The name then devolved specifically to third magnitude (3.40) Zeta Pegasi, leaving poor fourth magnitude Xi Peg (which lies just to the northeast of Zeta) nameless.
