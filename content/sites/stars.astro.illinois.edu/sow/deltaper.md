excerpt: >-
  DELTA PER (Delta Persei). Dominated as it is by its two brightest stars, Mirfak and Algol (Alpha and Beta Persei), the next four stars of glorious Perseus, the mythical rescuer of Andromeda, are often ignored. This quartet, which consists of Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, and Zeta, are all nearly the same mid-third magnitude brightness, and add great sparkle to the northern constellation.
