title: "Alioth (stars.astro.illinois.edu)"
author: Jim Kaler
excerpt: >-
  ALIOTH (Epsilon Ursae Majoris). The graceful curve of handle of the Big Dipper (the Plough in Great Britain), among the most famed of celestial sights, represents the tail of Ursa Major, the Greater Bear. Third star in from the end, "Alioth" relates not to a bear, but to a "black horse," the name corrupted from the original and misassigned to the naked-eye companion of Mizar, which took on the vaguely similar name "Alcor."
