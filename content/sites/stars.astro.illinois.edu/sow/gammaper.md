excerpt: >-
  GAMMA PER (Gamma Persei). The naming of stars at times seems to have little to do with their brightnesses. All the first magnitude stars, and most of the second magnitude visible from classical lands, have names (an outstanding exception being Gamma Cassiopeiae), but from there on the naming is erratic.
