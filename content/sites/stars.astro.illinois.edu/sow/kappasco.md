excerpt: >-
  KAPPA SCO (Kappa Scorpii). The curves of stars that make the body of Scorpius, the Scorpion, is one of the most dramatic and recognizable figures of the nightly sky. At the southeastern end, just short of the two-star "stinger" (made of Shaula and Lesath) lies bright, second magnitude (2.41) Kappa Scorpii, which if in most other constellations would bear a proper name, but here tends to be lost among the host of other bright stars.
