excerpt: >-
  GAMMA TRA (Gamma Trianguli Australis). If this star were not so bright -- within the top 150 stars -- it would probably be ignored. But at mid-third magnitude (2.89), it just barely makes the list at number 149, and thus earns some measure of respect, which it deserves if for no other reason than that it anchors the southwest apex of bright and obvious Triangulum Australe (the Southern Triangle), which is dominated by mid-second magnitude Atria.
