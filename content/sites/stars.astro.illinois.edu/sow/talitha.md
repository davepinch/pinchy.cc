excerpt: >-
  TALITHA (Iota Ursae Majoris). Three close (but physically unrelated) pairs of stars make the feet of Ursa Major, the Great Bear. In Arabic culture, the three represent the "leaps" of a gazelle, Talitha (Bayer's "Iota" star) and Kappa Ursae Majoris making (and meaning) the westernmost "third leap" (the name actually coming from the number 3).
