excerpt: >-
  ASPIDISKE (Iota Carinae). Most stars have no proper name; even some bright ones lack them. How they would envy this one, with not one, but THREE, from each of the classic stellar languages. "Aspidiske" (the Greek Iota star in Carina, the Keel of the ship Argo) comes from the Greek, and means "little shield" (referring to a decoration, not a defensive weapon).
