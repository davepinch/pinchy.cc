excerpt: >-
  ALPHARD (Alpha Hydrae). Not all that well known among bright stars, but surprisingly prominent, Alphard both dominates and lies at the heart of the relatively dim constellation Hydra, the Water Serpent (the longest constellation of the sky), hence clearly deserves to be Bayer's Alpha star.
