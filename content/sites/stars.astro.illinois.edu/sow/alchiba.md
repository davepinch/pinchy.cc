excerpt: >-
  ALCHIBA (Alpha Corvi). It is standard "knowledge" in astronomy that "Alpha" represents the brightest star in a constellation, "Beta" the second brightest, and so on. While such is often true, the rule is as much broken as held to, sometimes dramatically. Alchiba, the Alpha star of Corvus, the Crow, is a fine example.
