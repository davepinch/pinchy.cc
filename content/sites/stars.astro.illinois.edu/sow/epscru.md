excerpt: >-
  EPS CRU (Epsilon Crucis). Here is one of the most viewed of all stars, while at the same time being one of the most obscure. How can that be? At fourth magnitude (3.59, just fainter than third), Epsilon Crucis has a prominent place as the "fifth star" of one of the most famed of all constellations, Crux, the Southern Cross, lying almost on a line between brighter Delta Crucis (the Cross's most northerly star) and first magnitude Acrux (Alpha Crucis).
note: Epsilon Crucis was assigned the name Ginan by the IAU in 2017.
