excerpt: >-
  TANIA BOREALIS (Lambda Ursae Majoris). Three pairs of unrelated stars mark the feet of Ursa Major, the Great Bear. To the Arabs, they marked the "leaps of the gazelle," the first, second, and third leaps proceeding from east to west. Tania Borealis (Lambda Ursae Majoris) is the more northerly of the stars that make the "Second Leap," the name from a long phrase that means just that (plus the Latin for "northern").
