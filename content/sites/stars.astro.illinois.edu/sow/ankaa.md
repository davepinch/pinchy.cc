excerpt: >-
  Well into the southern hemisphere lies the modern constellation Phoenix, the mythical Phoenix or Firebird, named by southern hemisphere explorers and first noted in Bayer's Uranometria. The name of the bright second magnitude (2.39) luminary derives from a late application of the Arabic for the marvelous bird.
