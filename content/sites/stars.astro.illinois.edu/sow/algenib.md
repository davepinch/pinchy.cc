excerpt: >-
  ALGENIB (Gamma Pegasi). Though the brightest star of Pegasus is Enif, the Epsilon star, the stars of the Great Square are of such obvious note that Bayer gave them Alpha through Delta. Delta (Alpheratz), the brightest, actually belongs to Andromeda as Alpha Andromedae, leaving Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Pegasi (Markab, Scheat, and Algenib) ranking 3-2-4 in the constellation and 2-1-3 in the Square, Algenib the faintest of them.
