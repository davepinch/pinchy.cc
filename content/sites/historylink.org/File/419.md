  Lake Forest Park, located along the northern tip of Lake Washington, is one of King County's first planned communities. It has an estimated population (in 2021) of 13,358. From its inception in 1909 until today, the community has paid great attention to its natural surroundings. It has created a marriage of residential dwellings and wooded terrain quite unlike many other suburban cities.
