excerpt: >-
  Marysville is located in the west-central part of Snohomish County, five miles north-northeast of the county seat, Everett.  Although the origin of its name has been the subject of considerable debate, most now agree that it comes from Maria Comeford (1846-1904), the wife of the founding father of Marysville, James Comeford (1833-1909).  Comeford arrived in 1878; the town was platted in 1885, and in 1891 Marysville was incorporated. Long a small town known for its logging industry and later for its strawberry farms, Marysville has experienced rapid growth in the past quarter century, with its population quintupling between 1980 and 2000. The 2000 U.S. Census recorded a population of 25,315, with the town continuing to grow rapidly both in population and area today (2007), aided by multiple annexations during the past decade.
