essay number: 1059
excerpt: >-
  The small city of Medina is blessed with an almost pristine location on the eastern shore of Lake Washington, a short bridge crossing (ferry ride in earlier years) away from the pleasures and perils of Seattle. The city, which includes Evergreen Point, has a stable population of about 3,000 and a land area of 1.43 square miles. Throughout its history Medina has been a quiet (and increasingly affluent) residential community with little commercial activity, and quiet and residential it plans to stay.
