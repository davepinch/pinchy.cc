excerpt: >-
  FBeaux Arts Village (King County) is a tiny rectangle of a town on the Eastside of Lake Washington, surrounded by its far bigger neighbor, Bellevue. In 1909 it got its start with plans to become an art colony, but that vision never came to pass. A pleasant community developed instead, which incorporated in 1954 to avoid being annexed by Bellevue. Though the village remained a mix of middle- and upper-class residents for much of its history, in recent years it has grown more affluent, with many of its homes now valued at more than $1 million.
