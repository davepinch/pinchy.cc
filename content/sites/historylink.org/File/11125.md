  Hunts Point (King County) is a tiny, affluent community located on a tree-covered peninsula that juts into Lake Washington between Evergreen Point and Yarrow Point a few miles east of Seattle. First settled in the early 1900s and incorporated as a fourth-class town in 1955, Hunts Point in 2015 has a population of about 425. The town has a quiet, pleasant history and a strong sense of community, which it strives to maintain today.
