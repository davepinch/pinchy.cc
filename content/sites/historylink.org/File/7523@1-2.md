title: "islands of Island County (historylink.org)"
✂️: "At present [November 2005] Island County consists of just two large islands, Whidbey and Camano, and six small, uninhabited islands: Smith Island to the west, Deception and Pass islands in Deception Pass, and Ben Ure, Strawberry, and Baby islands in Saratoga Passage."
corrections: >-
  In 2006 (after this article was first published), the Washington state legislature formalized the definition of Island County to include Whidbey, Camano, Smith, Deception, Strawberry, Baby, Minor, Kalamut, and Ben Ure islands. Note that Pass Island is located in Skagit County, and Ben Ure and Strawberry islands are located in the Deception Pass (not the Saratoga Passage). Additionally, there are two rocky islets in Skagit Bay not mentioned in this article (or state law). They are located northeast of Dugualla Bay and can be seen in OpenStreetMap or satellite view on Google.
