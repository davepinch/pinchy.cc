  Winds up to 30 knots from the south and southwest could generate waves up to 2 meters (6 feet) high. During the summer, these waves are lower, corresponding to a weakening of the prevailing southerly wind velocities. Westerly winds up to 20 knots may build waves up to 11/2 meters (5 feet) high to attack Birch Point's western shore.
