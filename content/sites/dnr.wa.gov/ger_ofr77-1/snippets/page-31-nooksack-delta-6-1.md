  Of particular interest to artists and researchers are unusual weathering forms displayed upon the rocks within the shore zone. Mustoe (1971) studied the shoreline weathering characteristics of the Chuckanut Formation in order to explain some of the curious patterns that resemble cavities. Mustoe refers to these features as aveoli and attributes their formation to biochemical weathering of the rock surfaces.
