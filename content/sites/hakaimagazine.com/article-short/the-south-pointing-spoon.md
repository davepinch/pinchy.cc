title: "The South Pointing Spoon (hakaimagazine.com)"
author: Amorina Kingdon
excerpt: >-
  On a bronze plate, the little metal spoon balances exquisitely on its bowl. Each time itâ€™s tossed or spun, it comes to rest with its neck aiming south. This is a replica of the aptly named south pointing spoon, thought to be the first magnetized object ever used to tell direction. And it was the crucial precursor to the magnetic compass, one of the most important inventions in maritime history.
