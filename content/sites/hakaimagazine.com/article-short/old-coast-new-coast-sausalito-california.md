author: Jude Isabella
excerpt: >-
  Richardson Bay in Sausalito, California, is many things: a floating neighborhood of over 250 domiciles, an icon of the 20th-century counterculture movement, and a place to buy expensive art. Itâ€™s a place people write about and sing about, although none have composed the opera. Yet. (Proposed title: Raucous-ito.)
