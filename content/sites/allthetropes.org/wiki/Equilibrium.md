all the tropes of: Equilibrium
excerpt: >-
  Ultra-violent (although surprisingly bloodless) science fiction action film that either rips off or brilliantly homages every great work of dystopian fiction (particularly We). Although it's completely unoriginal, it's well-liked for being totally shiny.
