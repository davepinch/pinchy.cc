excerpt: >-
  **John Tyler** (aka "His Accidency") was the first Vice-President to inherit the Presidency. He was a longtime Democratic-Republican who was elected to the Vice Presidency on the Whig ticket, so he was rather unpopular with his former political supporters and had a tenuous relationship with his predecessor during his short vice-presidency.
