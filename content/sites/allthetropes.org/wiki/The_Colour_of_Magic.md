all the tropes of: The Colour of Magic
excerpt: >-
  The very first Discworld novel, from 1983. Unlike most of the later ones, ***The Colour of Magic*** was primarily a vehicle for Terry Pratchett to directly mock, play with and deconstruct other fantasy series, rather than the much broader field of his later work. Introduced his interest in using nuclear physics (his previous area of expertise as a scientific journalist) as a metaphor and parody for how magic works.
