excerpt: >-
  **Bill Clinton** was President of the United States from 1993-2001 (the first Democrat since FDR to be elected to two terms), ushering in an era of Democrats in power in the White House after twelve straight years of Republican rule. He is largely known in parody/satire for his playing of the saxophone (Which is, of course, Truth in Television due to Clinton being a skilled player of the sax) and as a Handsome Lech who was caught in a series of sex scandals, which threatened his Presidency towards the end of his second term.
