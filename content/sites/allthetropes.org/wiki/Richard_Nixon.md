all the tropes of: Richard Nixon
excerpt: >-
  The thirty-seventh President of the United States, and probably the most hated former president in U.S. history before politics polarized in the early 2000s (only Herbert Hoover is competition), **Richard Milhous Nixon** remains the standard-bearer as being the embodiment of the corrupt president. If President Corrupt shows up in fiction, there will probably be allusions to this guy.
