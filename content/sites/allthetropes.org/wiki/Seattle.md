excerpt: >-
  A city situated on the eastern bank of Puget Sound in the state of Washington, and its surrounding metro area. Named for a 19th century Duwamish tribal chief from the region, who did not give an environmental speech often attributed to him. Home base of (or at least origin-point for) Microsoft, Nintendo of America, Starbucks, Boeing, Amazon and several other companies of note, and the birthplace of Grunge music (Nirvana in particular, despite not being from here). Its landmarks include Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square (which pre-gentrification was the original Skid Row), The Experience Music Project, a half-mile Monorail constructed for the 1962 World's Fair which exemplifies Zeerust to a tee, the Seattle Underground which was a partial inspiration for Ankh-Morpork, and the Space Needle, also constructed for the World's Fair.
