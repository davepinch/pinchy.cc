excerpt: >-
  ***Super Mario World*** is a 1991 video game produced by Nintendo as a launch title for their sixteen-bit console, the Super Nintendo. It features their iconic mascot Mario taking a vacation alongside his brother Luigi and Princess Peach (then still referred to in America as Princess Toadstool) to the faraway Dinosaur Land. There, as is prone to happen, Princess Peach is captured by Bowser and kept in his castle, this time located in the deep underground. Of course, Mario must journey through the entire continent to get to her, beating down Bowser's loyal lackies/children, the seven Koopalings, along the way.
