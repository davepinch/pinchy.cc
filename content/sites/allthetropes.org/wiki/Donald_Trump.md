excerpt: >-
  **Donald John Trump** is the 45th President of the United States of America, succeeding Barack Obama. One of the few presidents to be known outside of political circles before his run, he was originally a real estate mogul known for slapping his name on the front of his innumerable hotels, casinos, resorts and golf courses. Prior to transferring his business assets to his children, most of his capital was rooted in New York City, where he owned several million square feet of property, including half of the Empire State Building. And prior to 2015 he held joint-ownership over the Miss Universe pageant, also encompassing Miss USA and Miss Teen USA. This is a secondary achievement to Donald's comb-over, which rivals any architecture he's built.
