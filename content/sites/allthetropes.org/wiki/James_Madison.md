excerpt: >-
  **James Madison** was one of the Founding Fathers. He presided over the War of 1812, wherein much of Washington D.C. was burnt down; fortunately for him this happened after he had already been elected to a second term. Many things were named after him, including New York City's Madison Square Garden. Also, there are brands of ice cream and snack cakes named after his wife, Dolley (a famous hostess).
