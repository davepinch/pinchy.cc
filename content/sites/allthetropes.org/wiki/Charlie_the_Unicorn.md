all the tropes of: Charlie the Unicorn
excerpt: >-
  Charlie the Unicorn is a silly video by Film Cow following the short adventure of a pink unicorn and a blue unicorn dragging their ..."friend" Charlie, a gray unicorn, on an adventure to the magical Candy Mountain (sadly not the MAD Candy Mountain Kirby goes to). After some time, a sequel came out about their quest to return the magical amulet to the Banana King, and a third episode about saving the future soon made the series a trilogy. All the videos really rely on the Pink and Blue unicorns' nonsensical behavior and the fact that Charlie seems to be the only one in any video with an ounce of rationality.
