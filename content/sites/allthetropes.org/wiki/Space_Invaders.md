excerpt: >-
  The Trope Maker that spawned a thousand other Shoot'Em Ups, ***Space Invaders*** debuted in 1978. Although Pong had started the industry, this game revolutionized it, virtually launching The Golden Age of Video Games, establishing or codifying many of the tropes used in later games, such as Video Game Lives, and a separate score counter for high scores.
