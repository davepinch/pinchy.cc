excerpt: >-
  Grover Cleveland (born Stephen Grover Cleveland) was the only American president to hold two non-consecutive terms, as the 22nd and 24th president (1885–89, 1893–97). Benjamin Harrison was the 23rd president, winning a bizarre race in 1888 in which Cleveland won the popular vote but Harrison prevailed in the Electoral College. Cleveland was also the second American president to get married while in office, and the only one to marry in the White House itself. He was also the only Democratic president in a period (1869-1913) of Republican executive dominance.
