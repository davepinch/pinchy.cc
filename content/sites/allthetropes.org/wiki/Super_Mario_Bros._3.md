excerpt: >-
  **Super Mario Bros. 3** is the third installment in the Super Mario Bros series by Nintendo. The final installment in the trilogy, it featured several new power-ups and features, in addition to a much larger selection of levels, enemies, and so forth (including Bowser's kids). It was a huge commercial success, rivaling the original Super Mario game. SMB 3 was also the first Mario game to have a specific cartoon Spin-Off, in the form of The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3. It also received advance publicity from an otherwise non-notable movie called The Wizard (film).
