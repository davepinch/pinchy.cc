all the tropes of: John Quincy Adams
excerpt: >-
  The sixth U.S. President, and the first son of a former president to be elected president (only George W. Bush has done so since then). Allegedly enjoyed skinny-dipping in the Potomac in the early morning during his presidency and pimped for the Russian Czar (at least that's what the Jacksonians believe). He was also ugly as sin and is considered the scariest-looking president ever, a fact we know for sure as he was the first President with a surviving photograph (and likely the first photographed period).
