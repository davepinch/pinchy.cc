all the tropes of: Dwight D. Eisenhower
excerpt: >-
  **Dwight David Eisenhower** was given this name by his mom, hoping nobody would make a nickname for him. As you may have noted, it didn't work, he ended up being known as "Ike". He was President from 1953 to 1961, being the first President to be barred from running for the office again via the 22nd Amendment (he was opposed to that amendment).
