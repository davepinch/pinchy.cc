excerpt: >-
  A cult Mind Screw film, set in October 1988, about a schizophrenic teenager called Donnie Darko who sees a demonic rabbit figure named "Frank" while sleepwalking. Frank tells him that the world will end in 28 days, just before a jet engine crashes into Donnie's bedroom. Donnie credits Frank with saving his life by causing him to sleepwalk out of the house, and begins to do Frank's bidding, while gradually trying to uncover the strange events around him which may or may not be related either to Time Travel, an Alternate Dimension, or Donnie's worsening Schizophrenia.
