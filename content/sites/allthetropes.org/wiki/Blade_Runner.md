excerpt: >-
  ***Blade Runner*** is a genre-bending 1982 Science Fiction film that borrows stylistic elements from Film Noir and Hardboiled Detective fiction. Set in a dystopian near-future City Noir version of Los Angeles, it established much of the tone and flavor of the Cyberpunk movement and the film style of Tech Noir. It is a highly intelligent film, visually stunning and features a seriously great script. The definitive high-def/Blu-Ray Directors Cut came out in 2007.
