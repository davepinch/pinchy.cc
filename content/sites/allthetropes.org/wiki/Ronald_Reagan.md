all the tropes of: Ronald Reagan
excerpt: >-
  Yes, he's the actor who became President. The thing is, a lot of these jokes don't work because he was only the "former actor who's running for Governor of California"; after that, he was "two term Governor of California who's running for President." Which is a kind of scary concept, if you're unfamiliar with the clause which excludes all foreign-born people from becoming President.
