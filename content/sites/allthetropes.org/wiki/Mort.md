excerpt: >-
  Fourth Discworld book and the first to really develop the character of Death, going from the sadistic murderer of the earlier books to the complex sympathetic-to-humans figure who does his Duty. However, it did build upon themes raised in a brief foray to Death's house in The Light Fantastic.
