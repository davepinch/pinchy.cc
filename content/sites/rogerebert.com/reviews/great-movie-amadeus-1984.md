title: "Amadeus (rogerebert)"
author: Roger Ebert
excerpt: >-
  Happy people are pleased by the happiness of others. The miserable are poisoned by envy. They vote with Gore Vidal and David Merrick, both credited with saying, “It is not enough that I succeed. Others must fail.” Milos Forman‘s “Amadeus” is not about the genius of Mozart but about the envy of his rival Salieri, whose curse was to have the talent of a third-rate composer but the ear of a first-rate music lover, so that he knew how bad he was, and how good Mozart was.
