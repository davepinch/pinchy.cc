excerpt: >-
  There may be people who overlook the Arnold Schwarzenegger performance in “Total Recall” – who think he isn’t really acting. But the performance is one of the reasons the movie works so well. He isn’t a superman this time, although he fights like one. He’s a confused and frightened innocent, a man betrayed by the structure of reality itself. And in his vulnerability, he opens the way for “Total Recall” to be more than simply an action, violence and special effects extravaganza.
