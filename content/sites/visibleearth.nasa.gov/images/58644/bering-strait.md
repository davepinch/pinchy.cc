excerpt: >-
  Although the landscapes of Alaska (right) and Russia (left) were covered in snow, the sea ice in the Bering Strait between them appears to be breaking up and receding slightly in this MODIS image from April 22, 2002. The coastal waters of southwestern Alaska are showing dark swirls that could be a mixture of sediment and phytoplankton.
