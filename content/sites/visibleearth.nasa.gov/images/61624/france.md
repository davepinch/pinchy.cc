excerpt: >-
  An unusually cloud-free France shows green and tan in this true-color Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) image acquired August 14, 2002, by the Terra satellite. The great city of Paris is visible in the upper center of the image as a gray smudge against the landscape, and is even clearer in the higher resolutions of this image.
