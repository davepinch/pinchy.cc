excerpt: >-
  This true-color MODIS image shows southern British Columbia (upper left) and Washington State. In the left center of the image lies Vancouver Island, which is separated from Washington by the Juan de Fuca Strait. British Columbia's glacier-capped Coast Mountain Range runs northwest-southeast inland from Vancouver Island. The brownish region to the interior of Washington and Oregon to the south is the Columbia Plateau, cut off from Pacific Ocean moisture by the Cascade Mountain Range, home to Mt. Rainer. Mt. Rainer is the white cluster of pixels to the immediate east-southeast of where Puget Sound dips far south into Washington.
