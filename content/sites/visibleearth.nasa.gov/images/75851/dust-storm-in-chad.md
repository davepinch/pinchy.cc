title: "Dust Storm in Chad (visibleearth.nasa.gov)"
author: Jeff Schmaltz
excerpt: >-
  A dust storm blew through part of eastern Chad on June 11, 2006. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) flying onboard NASAâ€™s Terra satellite captured this image of the storm as it blew toward Lake Chad. In this image, the dust appears as a wisp of pale beige set against a darker tan background. Lake Chad, near the border with Nigeria and Cameroon, is barely visible in this image, although it has been easily discernible in other satellite images.
