title: "Dust Storm over the Persian Gulf (visibleearth.nasa.gov)"
author: Jeff Schmaltz
excerpt: >-
  Tan clouds of airborne dust obscured the Persian Gulf when the Terra MODIS instrument flew over the region to collect this image on January 7, 2005. The dust is blowing out of Iraq and Iran in the northwest where winds were reported to be blowing at 13 kilometers per hour (8 mph) near the coast. MODIS also detected a few scattered fires in the region, which have been marked with red dots.
