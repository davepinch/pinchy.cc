excerpt: >-
  NASA—s Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) captured this series of true-color images of eastern and northeastern Greenland in June and July 2002. Summer is well underway in this frigid place, and snow and sea ice are retreating form the rugged coastlines. Off shore, fine white swirls are made by finely crushed ice.
