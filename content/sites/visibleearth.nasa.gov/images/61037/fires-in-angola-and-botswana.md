excerpt: >-
  This series of MODIS images shows biomass burning in southern Africa in April, May, June, and July 2002. The images span a number of different viewpoints of the region, but the country of Angola, with its highly dendritic (carved by rivers) geological formations are common to them all. Many of the images show parts of adjacent countries, with Angola usually at top left. As a reference point, locate the brightly-colored, salty soils of the Etosha Pan in north-central Namibia. Angola is north of Namibia and Botswana is east. Northeast of Botswana is Zimbabwe, and due north is Zambia. In many images, the Okavango River creates a green, broomstick-shaped delta in Botwsana. In the false-color images, vegetation is pale green, and burned areas are reddish brown. In both kinds of images, fires are marked with red dots.
