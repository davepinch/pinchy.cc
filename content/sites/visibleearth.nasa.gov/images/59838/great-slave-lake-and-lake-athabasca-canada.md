excerpt: >-
  These true- and false-color images of central Canada show the Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories (top) and Lake Athabasca to the southeast. Lake Athabasca straddles the border between Alberta (west) and Saskatchewan (east). A fire (red dot) is burning in Saskatchewan, and the snow capped Rocky Mountains cut through southwest Alberta at bottom left. In the false-color image, vegetation is green, water is dark blue, and ice (or snow) is light blue.
