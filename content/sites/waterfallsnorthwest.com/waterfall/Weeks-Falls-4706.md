excerpt: >-
  Weeks Falls is the fourth of five major waterfalls along the South Fork Snoqualmie River. The river cascades down a jagged pitch, dropping 77 feet in a run of about 300 feet. Immediately above the falls is a small dam which diverts about ¾ of the river into a micro hydro facility, leaving the falls a shadow of their natural self for the majority of the year. A visit between January and May should yield better results. The photos shown here were taken in late May of 2006 when the river was running at about 900 cubic feet per second. Weeks Falls is enclosed in a lightly developed corner of Olallie State Park, with trails connecting to Iron Horse State Park and the Twin Falls section of Olallie as well.
