title: "Fall Into The Wall (waterfallsnorthwest.com)"
excerpt: >-
  This small waterfall is situated immediately downstream of where Interstate 90 splits to opposite sides of the valley near Snoqualmie Pass. The South Fork of the Snoqualmie River plunges 22 feet into a small gorge and essentially slams into a wall which the river must circumvent by making a sharp horseshoe bend in the gorge. During low flow periods the falls will split into two segments. Should a safe method of crossing the river be found, an excellent view of the falls could be attained by climbing out on top of the "wall" that the river is so rudely interrupted by.
