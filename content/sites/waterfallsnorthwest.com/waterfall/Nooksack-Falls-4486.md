excerpt: >-
  Nooksack Falls is one of the most popular waterfalls in the North Cascades, as well as an essential pit stop on the way to Heather Meadows at the end of Highway 542. The falls plunge 88 feet in two segments. There has been some confusion regarding the height of the falls. Most accounts place the height at 170 feet. We have no idea where this figure initially originated, but it seems to have been propagated by Greg Plumb's "Waterfall Lover's Guide to the Pacific Northwest". Signs which have since been erected at the falls clarify the height to be 88 feet, and this measurement has been bore out to be accurate by both our subsequent field surveys and high resolution lidar data.
