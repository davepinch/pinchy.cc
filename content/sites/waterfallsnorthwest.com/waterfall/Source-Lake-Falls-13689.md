title: "Source Lake Falls (Northwest Waterfall Survey)"
excerpt: >-
  The South Fork of the Snoqualmie River officially starts at Source Lake in the basin just north of the Alpental Ski Area at Snoqualmie Pass. Though diminutive in size its outflow is fed by several rocky alpine basins higher up on the ridgeline below Bryant and Chair Peaks which punctuate the skyline in the Alpental area. As the fledgling river meanders out of the lake and through sub-alpine huckleberry meadows, it encounters a very nondescript headwall and inconspicuously plunges over a three-stage waterfall which were it situated along the nearby Snow Lake Trail would be one of the marquis destinations for hikers in the immediate Snoqualmie Pass area.
