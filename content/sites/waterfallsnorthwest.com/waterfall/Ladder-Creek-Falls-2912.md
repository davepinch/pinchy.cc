title: "Ladder Creek Falls (waterfallsnorthwest.com)"
excerpt: >-
  Ladder Creek has cut itself a fairly impressive slot canyon which harbors a very pretty three-tiered waterfall. While the falls are easily visible from the rim of the gorge, all tiers of the falls are obscured in some way or another - some more than others - by the twisting walls of the chasm. The upper and middle tiers drop 34 and 28 feet in back-to-back fashion, but both are highly obstructed by the shape of the canyon. The 46-foot lower tier is the most visible of the set but can be partially obstructed unless viewing it in a very specific area (near a large tree right next to the stairs).
