excerpt: >-
  Ontological arguments are arguments, for the conclusion that God exists, from premises which are supposed to derive from some source other than observation of the worldâ€”e.g., from reason alone. In other words, ontological arguments are arguments from what are typically alleged to be none but analytic, a priori and necessary premises to the conclusion that God exists.
