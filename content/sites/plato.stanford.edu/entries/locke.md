excerpt: >-
  John Locke (b. 1632, d. 1704) was a British philosopher, Oxford academic and medical researcher. Lockeâ€™s monumental *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding* (1689) is one of the first great defenses of modern empiricism and concerns itself with determining the limits of human understanding in respect to a wide spectrum of topics. It thus tells us in some detail what one can legitimately claim to know and what one cannot.
