title: "S'Klallam and Chemakum Indian tribes on Olympic Peninsula when Jarman settled there in 1848-52 (skagitriverjournal.com)"
excerpt: >-
  We spun this story off from the William "Blanket Bill" Jarman biography in order to address the considerable confusion and contradiction in various accounts about the tribes present on the Olympic Peninsula when Jarman settled there temporarily, off and on, in the period 1848-52. The contradictions were present in both the contemporary U.S. Government documents of that time, private writing later in the century and books by various historians between then and now. In our review, we will also explain the genealogy of Alice, Jarman's wife and companion for the next three decades. She and the Indians that Jarman met in that period helped shape both his life and the legends about him.
