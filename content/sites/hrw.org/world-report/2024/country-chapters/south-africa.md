excerpt: >-
  In 2023, former President Jacob Zumaâ€™s corruption trial faced delays, raising questions as to whether Zuma would be held accountable. Members of the VIP Protection Unit of the South African Police Service (SAPS) were suspended for misconduct, facing charges of assault, malicious damage to property, and pointing a firearm at civilians. Environmental challenges remain a concern as air pollution continues to harm the health and well-being of South Africans. Entrenched sexual violence and discrimination prevent the realization of the rights of women and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. While guaranteed in legislation, the rights of older people and children have come under threat, and xenophobia against African and Asian foreign nationals continued throughout the year.
