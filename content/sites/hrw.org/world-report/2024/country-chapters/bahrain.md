excerpt: >-
  More than 800 inmates in Jau prison, the country’s largest detention facility, participated in a hunger strike from August to September 2023 to protest abysmal conditions and Bahraini authorities’ denial of adequate health care. Many of those on hunger strike were being held unjustly following manifestly unfair trials.
