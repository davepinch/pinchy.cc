title: "World Report 2024: Papua New Guinea (hrw.org)"
excerpt: >-
  Although a resource-rich country, the World Bank estimates that almost 40 percent of the population of Papua New Guinea (PNG) lives in poverty, with only 20.9 percent having access to electricity. Most people in PNG live without consistent access to clean water. James Marape is now into his second term as prime minister, and despite promising to address rampant corruption and discrimination against women, PNGâ€™s human rights record has not improved.
