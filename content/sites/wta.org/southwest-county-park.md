excerpt: >-
  This park in Edmonds features 120 acres of open space with plenty of branching, interconnected trails for exploring. The trail system on the south side of Olympic View Drive is easy and relatively flat, featuring some hills that roll through the quiet forest. Trails intersect and wind around each other; it is easy to get quite a bit of mileage in this park.
