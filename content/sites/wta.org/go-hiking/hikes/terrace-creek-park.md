excerpt: >-
  This 60 acre park in Mountlake Terrace - sometimes referred to locally as Candy Cane Park - includes a mile of Lyon Creek as it flows through a mixed deciduous-coniferous forest. The stream does qualify as a small creek during the wet season, and it eventually flows into Lake Washington. But in late spring the creek may be reduced to a trickle, and at the end of a long summer it could be almost dry.
