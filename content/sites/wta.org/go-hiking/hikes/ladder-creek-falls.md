excerpt: >-
  Located behind the Gorge Powerhouse in Newhalem, Ladder Creek Falls offers a refreshing woodland retreat with exotic flora and close-up views of the third tier of this spectacular waterfall. When the hydroelectric project near Ross Lake was under construction during the 1930s and '40s, owner and developer J.D. Ross built a trail to nearby Ladder Creek Falls to showcase the area.
