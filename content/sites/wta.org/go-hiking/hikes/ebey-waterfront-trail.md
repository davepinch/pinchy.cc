excerpt: >-
  The Ebey Waterfront Trail is a beautiful trail right along the water in Marysville with an interesting back story. The trail offers views of the Qwuloolt Estuary. For more than 100 years, the area had been cut off from the flows of salt and freshwater. In August of 2015, however, a levee was breached, allowing the area to return to a more natural habitat.  Interpretive signs along the way tell the interesting story of the area. And even though the trail starts right in town, it features stellar views of the estuary, the Snohomish River and the Olympic and Cascade mountains.
