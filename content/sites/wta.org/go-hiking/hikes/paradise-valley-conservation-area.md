excerpt: >-
  This wild wood started out as a working farm and timber producing homestead over one hundred years ago. It became part of the Snohomish County Park system in 2000, and now is in the process of returning to the wild state it once was. We hikers can watch this dynamic landscape by following the many trails that run through it. The trails are all well signed and a map can be printed or downloaded to your smartphone from the Snohomish County Parks website. Hike the perimeter trails for a good sampling of the area and a nice hike of about 5 miles.
