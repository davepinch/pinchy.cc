excerpt: >-
  Fort Ward Park has a rich history and a variety of trails. This park used to be a military fort to protect the navy yards in Bremerton. It was closed in the â€˜60s and has been public land ever since, first as a state park and now as a local city park. You will find a few remnants of this military past along the beach, but the majority of the park is in a natural setting.
