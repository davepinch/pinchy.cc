excerpt: >-
  Hamlin Park, the largest and oldest park in the city of Shoreline, is named for the pioneering Hamlin family who had a homestead in the area in the late 19th century. During their tenure, the Hamlins logged much of the area, but the forest gradually returned. Today many second-growth trees here are over 100 years old. Mostly you will see cedars and firs, along with a few madrones and a variety of other deciduous trees.
