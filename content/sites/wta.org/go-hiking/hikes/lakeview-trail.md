excerpt: >-
  Follow a gentle, stroller-friendly slope for about a mile along the eastern and northern shores of scenic Lake Ballinger. You can extend your walk by continuing west along Lakeview Drive to the nearby Interurban Trail, or head east to explore the gravel forested path through Terrace Creek Park, 23200 48th Ave W, a popular destination for disc golf. Regardless of your route, the Mountlake Terrace Transit Center makes a good starting point.
