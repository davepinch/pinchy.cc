title: "Meadowdale Beach Park - Lunds Gulch (wta.org)"
excerpt: >-
  This is a great all-season hike featuring beautiful mature second growth forest and beach access. Hike down a lushly forested ravine with a babbling creek, home to many species of salmon and trout. Follow the creek to its estuary as it empties into Puget Sound. If you extend your hike to the beach, breathe in the serene panorama of Brownâ€™s Bay, Puget Sound, the islands, and the Olympic Mountains. Watch the seabirds and go beachcombing to look for crabshells, anemones, and other treasures.
