excerpt: >-
  This Shoreline city park offers good trails that pass through areas of low forest and circle two small lakes. Hikers may prefer the approach from the west side via the Trail of the Cedars. The route described here begins at that trailhead but gets to every part of the park, including the eastern trailheads, so you can easily modify your route if you prefer a different starting point.
