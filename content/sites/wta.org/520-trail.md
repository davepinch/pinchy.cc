title: "520 Trail (wta.gov)"
excerpt: >-
  Starting at the western end, the trail jumps right up to the elevated road level at East Montlake Park and continues east past Marsh and Foster Islands. There is access to the Arboretum Waterfront and Lake Washington Ship Canal trails from this western starting point as well.  Follow the trail dropping down from the western high rise of the 520 bridge and across Lake Washington. Don't miss several very nice trail pullouts along the length of the bridge with interpretive signage on the area's history and wildlife. After reaching the eastern shore, the trail crosses through 520 Bridge View Park, a second easy access point and a good turn around place if you are only interested in the bridge walk.
