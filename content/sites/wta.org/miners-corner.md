  This 13-acre Snohomish County park in Bothell offers about a mile of trails, all of them wide, paved and ADA accessible. The park has a lot of open grassy areas, other areas where the trails pass through forest, and it has a large playground area. Wherever possible, native vegetation has been replanted or maintained. As in any urban park, it is easy to make your own adventure. Or, if you prefer to follow a suggested route, you could try the following loop.
