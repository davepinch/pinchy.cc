excerpt: >-
  The trails in Warren G. Magnuson Park are frequented and beloved by locals, but are often overlooked by those just passing through Seattle. The Frog Pond Trail is a series of paths that are part of a wetland reconstruction project that seeks to restore parts of the former military base. They feature ducks, ponds, well-maintained gravel, and a welcome stillness within what is normally a chaotic area. Three of these trails, described below, make up the possible outings at Magnuson Park.
