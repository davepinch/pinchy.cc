excerpt: >-
  Alejandro Jodorowsky's cult film The Holy Mountain, newly restored in 4K, firmly established the director as an auteur of Surrealist Cinema, and sparked controversy at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival due to its sacrilegious imagery. The director himself plays The Alchemist, a guru who guides a troupe of pilgrims, each representing the planets in the solar system, on a magical quest to Lotus Island where they must ascend the Holy Mountain in search of spiritual enlightenment.
