excerpt: >-
  Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest film directors who directed classics like 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining, Dr. Strangelove and A Clockwork Orange. But behind the scenes he was known for his pursuit of perfection which was both legendary and notorious. From pushing actors beyond exhaustion to demanding hundreds of takes for a single scene, he showcased his unparalleled attention to detail and his ability to master any genre he tackled. His 13 films are filled with complex and sometimes controversial characters. But none of those characters are as complex or fascinating as Kubrick himself.
