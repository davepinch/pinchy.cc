excerpt: >-
  We've got to the point where fully CGI characters can be near flawless, we easily forget that Caesar from Planet of the Apes, Davy Jones from Pirates of the Caribbean or Gollum from Lord of the Rings are just visual effects creations, and accept the illusion without second thought. How did we get here? What makes good CGI characters good and bad CGI characters bad? Join me and Andy Serkis as we explore the development of motion capture and performance capture, and look at a few examples which demonstrate how to use this technology most effectively.
