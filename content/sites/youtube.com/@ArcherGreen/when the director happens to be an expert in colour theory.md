excerpt: >-
  Join me as we explore how director Damien Chazelle made use of colours in La La Land. Instead of using the standard emotional connotations for certain colours, Chazelle gives each colour its own thematic resonance and narrative weight, adding an extra layer to the visual storytelling. He uses inspirations ranging from German Expressionism to classical Hollywood to create a film that is not only colourful, but uses these colours for specific purposes.
