  The Western genre is one of the most recognisable genres out there, with many classics such as 'Once Upon a Time in the West' and 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.' When people think of classic films, no doubt Westerns spring to mind. But why are they so memorable? And why have they had such a lasting impact on popular culture and cinema as a whole? This video aims to answer this question by examining what makes them so cool, by focussing on Sergio Leone's western filmography.
