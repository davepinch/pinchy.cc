  I am a geology professor, author of Geology Underfoot in Southern Idaho, co-author of Roadside Geology of Idaho, and a licensed professional geologist. I love exploring the Earth's rocks and landscapes and sharing these stories with others. On this channel, I post a variety of engaging videos to help folks understand geology from a variety of locations throughout the western US and beyond. Most of my videos are field-based, where geology is learned best, but I also have some longer lecture style videos as well as short lessons on rocks and other topics.  I treat my viewers as fellow learners as we explore Earth's wonders together as part of a collective "team."
