death valley of: German
excerpt: >-
  This is the tale of what for me was a rather remarkable adventure.  It was assembled on the basis of my personal recollection and experience, emails, GPS logs and some official documents.  It represents solely the perspective and opinions of myself, in my more lucid moments.  It is in no way intended to represent the position of the Riverside Mountain Rescue Unit, nor any other agency mentioned.  Further, my usual writing style tends to be somewhat lighthearted and flippant, which would be somewhat at odds with the serious and tragic nature of the incident being reported.  I have attempted to remain sensitive to the underlying events, yet retain a certain level of casual narrative that some might find entertaining.  And if not entertaining, then at least informative.
