adolf hitler of: David Pinch
memory: >-
  My earliest memory of Hitler is seeing a black and white speech on television from the living room of our home in Minnesota, sometime before 1991. I remember that he sounded angry, and I wondered what he was saying. Later in high school we watched a video for history class and I distinctly remember the famous photograph of Hitler looking out the window at Lansberg Prison.
