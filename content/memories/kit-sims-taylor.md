  I came across Kit Sims Taylor while researching the history of Appletree Cove (the bay around Kingston, Washington). His website, "appletreecovegraphics.com", came up during a search of the Internet Archive. I checked the website out of curiosity and found the work of photographer. The website went offline in 2012 with his passing, but fortunately the Internet Archive made some captures so that people can forever see his work.
