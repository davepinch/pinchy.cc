    Being a part of the [Cascade Range](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Range), they are the only place where the Cascades come west down to meet the sea. The Chuckanuts are considered to be a part of the Puget Lowland Forest Ecoregion.

    The Chuckanut Mountains were formed by the folding of the [Chuckanut Formation](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuckanut_Formation) (which is predominantly made up of layers of 55-million-year-old [sandstone](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandstone), conglomerate, [shale](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shale), and bituminous and sub-bituminous coal) and the later Huntingdon Formation (predominantly shale and sandstone) on top, as well as an exposed section of pre-Jurassic-age phyllite
