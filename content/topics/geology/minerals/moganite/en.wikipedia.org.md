  **Moganite** is an oxide mineral with the chemical formula SiO2 (silicon dioxide) that was discovered in 1976. It was initially described as a new form of silica from specimens found in the Barranco de Medio Almud, in the municipality of Mog√°n on the island of Gran Canaria, in the Canary Islands ([Spain](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain/)), receiving in a later work the name derived from this locality. In 1994 the International Mineralogical Association decided to disapprove it as a valid mineral, since it was considered indistinguishable from quartz. Subsequent studies allowed the IMA to rectify it in 1999, accepting it as a mineral species. It has the same chemical composition as [quartz](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz/), but a different crystal structure.
