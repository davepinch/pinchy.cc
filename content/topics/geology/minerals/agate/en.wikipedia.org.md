  **Agate** (/ˈæɡɪt/) is the banded variety of [chalcedony](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcedony), which comes in a wide variety of colors. Agates are primarily formed within volcanic and metamorphic rocks. The ornamental use of agate was common in Ancient Greece, in assorted jewelry and in the seal stones of Greek warriors, while bead necklaces with pierced and polished agate date back to the 3rd millennium BCE in the Indus Valley civilisation.
