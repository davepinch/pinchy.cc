  **Earth science** or **geoscience** includes all fields of natural science related to the planet [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/). This is a branch of science dealing with the physical, chemical, and biological complex constitutions and synergistic linkages of Earth's four spheres: the biosphere, hydrosphere/cryosphere, atmosphere, and geosphere (or lithosphere). Earth science can be considered to be a branch of planetary science but with a much older history.
