The **Paleogene** (IPA: /ˈpeɪli.ədʒiːn, -li.oʊ-, ˈpæli-/ *PAY-lee-ə-jeen*, *-⁠lee-oh-*, *PAL-ee-*; also spelled **Palaeogene** or **Palæogene**; informally **Lower Tertiary** or **Early Tertiary**) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period 66 million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the [Neogene](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neogene) Period 23.03 Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The earlier term Tertiary Period was used to define the span of time now covered by the Paleogene Period and subsequent Neogene Period; despite no longer being recognized as a formal stratigraphic term, "Tertiary" still sometimes remains in informal use. Paleogene is often abbreviated "Pg" (but the United States Geological Survey uses the abbreviation Pe for the Paleogene on the Survey's geologic maps).
