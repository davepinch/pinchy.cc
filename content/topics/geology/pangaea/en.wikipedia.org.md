excerpt: >-
  **Pangaea** or **Pangea** (/pænˈdʒiː.ə/) was a supercontinent that existed during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras. It assembled from the earlier continental units of Gondwana, Euramerica and Siberia during the Carboniferous approximately 335 million years ago, and began to break apart about 200 million years ago, at the end of the Triassic and beginning of the Jurassic. In contrast to the present [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/) and its distribution of continental mass, Pangaea was centred on the equator and surrounded by the superocean [Panthalassa](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthalassa/) and the Paleo-Tethys and subsequent Tethys Oceans. Pangaea is the most recent supercontinent to have existed and the first to be reconstructed by geologists.
