excerpt: >-
  **Extrusive rock** refers to the mode of [igneous](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igneous_rock/) volcanic rock formation in which hot magma from inside the [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/) flows out (extrudes) onto the surface as lava or explodes violently into the atmosphere to fall back as pyroclastics or tuff. In contrast, [intrusive rock](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusive_rock/) refers to rocks formed by magma which cools below the surface.
