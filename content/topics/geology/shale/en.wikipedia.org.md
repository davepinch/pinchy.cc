excerpt: >-
  **Shale** is a fine-grained, clastic [sedimentary rock](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentary_rock/) formed from mud that is a mix of flakes of clay minerals (hydrous aluminium phyllosilicates, e.g. kaolin, Al2Si2O5(OH)4) and tiny fragments (silt-sized particles) of other minerals, especially [quartz](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz/) and calcite. Shale is characterized by its tendency to split into thin layers (laminae) less than one centimeter in thickness. This property is called *fissility*. Shale is the most common sedimentary rock.
