excerpt: >-
  The **Cascadia subduction zone** is a 960 km (600 mi) fault at a convergent plate boundary, about 112-160 km (70-100 mi) off the Pacific Shore, that stretches from northern Vancouver Island in [Canada](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada/) to Northern California in the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States/). It is capable of producing 9.0+ magnitude earthquakes and tsunamis that could reach 30m (100 ft). The Oregon Department of Emergency Management estimates shaking would last 5-7 minutes along the coast, with strength and intensity decreasing further from the epicenter. It is a very long, sloping subduction zone where the Explorer, [Juan de Fuca](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_de_Fuca_Plate/), and Gorda plates move to the east and slide below the much larger mostly continental [North American Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Plate/). The zone varies in width and lies offshore beginning near Cape Mendocino, Northern California, passing through [Oregon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon/) and [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/), and terminating at about Vancouver Island in [British Columbia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia/).
