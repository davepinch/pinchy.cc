In geography and [geology](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology), **fluvial processes** are associated with rivers and streams and the deposits and landforms created by them. When the stream or rivers are associated with glaciers, ice sheets, or ice caps, the term **glaciofluvial** or fluvioglacial is used.
