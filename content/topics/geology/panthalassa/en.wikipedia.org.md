  **Panthalassa**, also known as the **Panthalassic Ocean** or **Panthalassan Ocean** (from Greek πᾶν "all" and θάλασσα "sea"), was the superocean that surrounded the supercontinent Pangaea, the latest in a series of supercontinents in the history of Earth. During the Paleozoic–Mesozoic transition c. 250 Ma it occupied almost 70% of Earth's surface. Its ocean floor has completely disappeared because of the continuous subduction along the continental margins on its circumference. Panthalassa is also referred to as the **Paleo-Pacific** ("old Pacific") or **Proto-Pacific** because the Pacific Ocean is a direct continuation of Panthalassa.
