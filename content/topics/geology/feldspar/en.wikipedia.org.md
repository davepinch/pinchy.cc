  **Feldspar** (/ˈfɛl(d)ˌspɑːr/ *FEL(D)-spar*; sometimes spelled **felspar**) is a group of rock-forming aluminium tectosilicate minerals, also containing other cations such as [sodium](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium/), calcium, potassium, or barium. The most common members of the feldspar group are the plagioclase (sodium-calcium) feldspars and the alkali (potassium-sodium) feldspars. Feldspars make up about 60% of the Earth's crust, and 41% of the Earth's continental crust by weight.
