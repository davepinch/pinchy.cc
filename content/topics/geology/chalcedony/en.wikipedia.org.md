excerpt: >-
  **Chalcedony** (/kælˈsɛdəni/ *kal-SED-ə-nee*, or /ˈkælsəˌdoʊni/ *KAL-sə-doh-nee*) is a cryptocrystalline form of silica, composed of very fine intergrowths of [quartz](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz/) and [moganite](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moganite/). These are both silica minerals, but they differ in that quartz has a trigonal crystal structure, while moganite is monoclinic. Chalcedony's standard chemical structure (based on the chemical structure of quartz) is SiO2 (silicon dioxide).
