excerpt: >-
  The **Mississippian** (/ˌmɪsɪˈsɪpi.ən/ *miss-ə-SIP-ee-ən*, also known as **Lower Carboniferous** or **Early Carboniferous**) is a subperiod in the geologic timescale or a subsystem of the geologic record. It is the earlier of two subperiods of the [Carboniferous](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboniferous/) period lasting from roughly 358.9 to 323.2 million years ago. As with most other geochronologic units, the rock beds that define the Mississippian are well identified, but the exact start and end dates are uncertain by a few million years. The Mississippian is so named because rocks with this age are exposed in the Mississippi Valley.
