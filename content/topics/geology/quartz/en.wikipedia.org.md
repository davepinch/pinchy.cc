excerpt: >-
  **Quartz** is a hard, crystalline mineral composed of silica (silicon dioxide). The atoms are linked in a continuous framework of SiO4 silicon–oxygen tetrahedra, with each oxygen being shared between two tetrahedra, giving an overall chemical formula of SiO2. Quartz is the second most abundant mineral in [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/)'s continental crust, behind feldspar.
