excerpt: >-
  **Greenschists** are metamorphic rocks that formed under the lowest temperatures and pressures usually produced by regional metamorphism, typically 300–450 °C (570–840 °F) and 2–10 kilobars (29,000–145,000 psi). Greenschists commonly have an abundance of green minerals such as chlorite, serpentine, and epidote, and platy minerals such as muscovite and platy serpentine. The platiness gives the rock schistosity (a tendency to split into layers). Other common minerals include [quartz](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz/), orthoclase, talc, carbonate minerals and amphibole (actinolite).
