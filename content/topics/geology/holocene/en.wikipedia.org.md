excerpt: >-
  The **Holocene** (/ˈhɒl.əsiːn, -oʊ-, ˈhoʊ.lə-, -loʊ-/) is the current geological epoch. It began approximately 9,700 years before the Common Era (BCE) (11,650 cal years BP, or 300 HE). It follows the Last Glacial Period, which concluded with the Holocene glacial retreat. The Holocene and the preceding [Pleistocene](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene/) together form the [Quaternary](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary/) period. The Holocene has been identified with the current warm period, known as MIS 1. It is considered by some to be an interglacial period within the Pleistocene Epoch, called the Flandrian interglacial.
