excerpt: >-
  The **St. Peter Sandstone** is an [Ordovician](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordovician/) geological formation. It belongs to the Chazyan stage of the Champlainian series in North American regional stratigraphy, equivalent to the late Darriwilian global stage. This sandstone originated as a sheet of sand in clear, shallow water near the shore of a [Paleozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleozoic/) sea and consists of fine-to-medium-size, well-rounded quartz grains with frosted surfaces. The extent of the formation spans north–south from [Minnesota](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota/) to [Arkansas](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas/) and east–west from [Illinois](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois/) into [Nebraska](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska/) and [South Dakota](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota). The formation was named by Owen (1847) after the Minnesota River, then known as the St. Peter River. The type locality is at the confluence of the [Mississippi](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River/) and Minnesota Rivers near Fort Snelling, Minnesota. In eastern [Missouri](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri/), the stone consists of quartz sand that is 99.44% silica.
