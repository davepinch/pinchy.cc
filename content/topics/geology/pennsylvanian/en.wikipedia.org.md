excerpt: >-
  The **Pennsylvanian** (/ˌpɛnsəlˈveɪni.ən/ pen-səl-VAYN-i-ən, also known as **Upper Carboniferous** or **Late Carboniferous**) is, on the ICS geologic timescale, the younger of two subperiods (or upper of two subsystems) of the [Carboniferous](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboniferous/) Period. It lasted from roughly 323.2 million years ago to 298.9 million years ago. As with most other geochronologic units, the rock beds that define the Pennsylvanian are well identified, but the exact date of the start and end are uncertain by a few hundred thousand years. The Pennsylvanian is named after the U.S. state of [Pennsylvania](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania/), where the coal-producing beds of this age are widespread.
