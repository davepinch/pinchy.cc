excerpt: >-
  A **bay** is a recessed, coastal body of water that directly connects to a larger main body of water, such as an ocean, a lake, or another bay. A large bay is usually called a *gulf*, *sea*, *sound*, or *bight*. A *cove* is a small, circular bay with a narrow entrance. A *fjord* is an elongated bay formed by glacial action. The term ***embayment*** is also used for related features, such as extinct bays or freshwater environments.
