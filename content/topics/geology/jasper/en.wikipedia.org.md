excerpt: >-
  **Jasper**, an aggregate of microgranular [quartz](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz) and/or cryptocrystalline [chalcedony](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcedony) and other mineral phases, is an opaque, impure variety of silica, usually red, yellow, brown or green in color; and rarely blue. The common red color is due to iron(III) inclusions. Jasper breaks with a smooth surface and is used for ornamentation or as a gemstone. It can be highly polished and is used for items such as vases, seals, and snuff boxes. The specific gravity of jasper is typically 2.5 to 2.9. Jaspillite is a banded-iron-formation rock that often has distinctive bands of jasper.
