excerpt: >-
  **Andesite** (/ˈændəzaɪt/) is a volcanic rock of intermediate composition. In a general sense, it is the intermediate type between silica-poor [basalt](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt/) and silica-rich rhyolite. It is fine-grained ([aphanitic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphanite/)) to porphyritic in texture, and is composed predominantly of sodium-rich plagioclase plus pyroxene or hornblende.
