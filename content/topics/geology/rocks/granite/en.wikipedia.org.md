  **Granite** (/ˈɡrænɪt/ GRAN-it) is a coarse-grained (phaneritic) [intrusive](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusive_rock/) [igneous rock](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igneous_rock/) composed mostly of [quartz](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz/), alkali feldspar, and plagioclase. It forms from magma with a high content of silica and alkali metal oxides that slowly cools and solidifies underground. It is common in the continental crust of [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/), where it is found in igneous intrusions. These range in size from dikes only a few centimeters across to batholiths exposed over hundreds of square kilometers.
