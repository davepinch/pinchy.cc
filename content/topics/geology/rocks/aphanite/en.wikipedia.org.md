excerpt: >-
  **Aphanites** (adj. *aphanitic*; from Ancient Greek αφανης (*aphanḗs*) 'invisible') are [igneous rocks](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igneous_rock) that are so fine-grained that their component [mineral](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral) crystals are not visible to the naked eye (in contrast to [phanerites](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanerite), in which the crystals are visible to the unaided eye). This geological texture results from rapid cooling in volcanic or hypabyssal (shallow subsurface) environments. As a rule, the texture of these rocks is not the same as that of volcanic glass (e.g., obsidian), with volcanic glass being non-crystalline (amorphous), and having a glass-like appearance.
