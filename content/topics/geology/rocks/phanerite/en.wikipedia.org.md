excerpt: >-
  A **phanerite** is an [igneous rock](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igneous_rock) whose microstructure is made up of crystals large enough to be distinguished with the unaided human eye. In contrast, the crystals in an [aphanitic rock](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphanite) are too fine-grained to be identifiable. Phaneritic texture forms when magma deep underground in the plutonic environment cools slowly, giving the crystals time to grow.
