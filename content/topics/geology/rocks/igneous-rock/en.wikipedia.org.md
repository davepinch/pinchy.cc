excerpt: >-
  **Igneous rock** (igneous from Latin *igneus* 'fiery'), or **magmatic rock**, is one of the three main [rock](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)) types, the others being [sedimentary](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentary_rock/) and metamorphic. Igneous rocks are formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava.
