excerpt: >-
  **Clastic rocks** are composed of fragments, or clasts, of pre-existing minerals and rock. A **clast** is a fragment of geological detritus, chunks, and smaller grains of rock broken off other rocks by physical weathering. Geologists use the term **clastic** to refer to sedimentary rocks and particles in sediment transport, whether in suspension or as bed load, and in sediment deposits.
