  The **Silurian** (/sɪˈljʊəriːən, saɪ-/ sih-LURE-ee-ən, sy-) is a geologic period and system spanning 24.6 million years from the end of the [Ordovician](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordovician/) Period, at 443.8 million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the [Devonian](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devonian/) Period, 419.2 Mya. The Silurian is the shortest period of the [Paleozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleozoic/) Era. As with other geologic periods, the rock beds that define the period's start and end are well identified, but the exact dates are uncertain by a few million years. The base of the Silurian is set at a series of major Ordovician–Silurian extinction events when up to 60% of marine genera were wiped out.
