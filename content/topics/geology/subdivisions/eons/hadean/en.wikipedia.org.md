  The **Hadean** (IPA: /heɪˈdiːən, ˈheɪdiən/ hay-DEE-ən, HAY-dee-ən) is the first and oldest of the four known geologic eons of [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/)'s history. The Hadean eon started with the planet's formation about 4.54 Bya, now defined as (4567.30 ± 0.16) Mya set by the age of the oldest solid material in the [Solar System](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System/) found in some meteorites about 4.567 billion years old. The proposed interplanetary collision that created the [Moon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon/) occurred early in this eon, and the Late Heavy Bombardment is hypothesized to have occurred at the end of the eon. The Hadean ended 4.031 billion years ago, and was succeeded by the [Archean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean/) eon.
