excerpt: >-
  The **Late Cretaceous** (100.5â€“66 Ma) is the younger of two epochs into which the [Cretaceous](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous/) Period is divided in the geologic time scale. Rock strata from this epoch form the Upper Cretaceous Series. The Cretaceous is named after creta, the Latin word for the white limestone known as chalk. The chalk of northern [France](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France/) and the white cliffs of south-eastern [England](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England/) date from the Cretaceous Period.
