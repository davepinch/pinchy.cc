excerpt: >-
  The Miocene (/ˈmaɪ.əsiːn, -oʊ-/ MY-ə-seen, -⁠oh-) is the first geological epoch of the [Neogene](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neogene) Period and extends from about 23.03 to 5.333 million years ago (Ma). The Miocene was named by Scottish geologist Charles Lyell; the name comes from the Greek words μείων (meíōn, "less") and καινός (kainós, "new") and means "less recent" because it has 18% fewer modern marine invertebrates than the Pliocene has. The Miocene is preceded by the [Oligocene](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligocene) and is followed by the [Pliocene](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliocene/).
