  The **Eocene** (IPA: /ˈiːəsiːn, ˈiːoʊ-/ *EE-ə-seen*, *EE-oh-*) Epoch is a geological epoch that lasted from about 56 to 33.9 million years ago (Ma). It is the second epoch of the [Paleogene](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleogene/) Period in the modern [Cenozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenozoic/) Era. The name Eocene comes from the Ancient Greek ἠώς (*ēṓs*, "dawn") and καινός (*kainós*, "new") and refers to the "dawn" of modern ('new') fauna that appeared during the epoch.
