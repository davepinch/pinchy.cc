excerpt: >-
  The **Late Triassic** is the third and final epoch of the [Triassic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triassic/) Period in the geologic time scale, spanning the time between 237 Ma and 201.4 Ma (million years ago). It is preceded by the [Middle Triassic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Triassic/) Epoch and followed by the [Early Jurassic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Jurassic/) Epoch. The corresponding series of rock beds is known as the Upper Triassic. The Late Triassic is divided into the Carnian, Norian and Rhaetian ages.
