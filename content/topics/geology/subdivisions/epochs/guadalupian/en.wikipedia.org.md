excerpt: >-
  The **Guadalupian** is the second and middle series/epoch of the [Permian](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian/). The Guadalupian was preceded by the [Cisuralian](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisuralian/) and followed by the [Lopingian](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lopingian/). It is named after the Guadalupe Mountains of New Mexico and Texas, and dates between 272.95 ± 0.5 – 259.1 ± 0.4 Mya. The series saw the rise of the therapsids, a minor extinction event called Olson's Extinction and a significant mass extinction called the end-Capitanian extinction event. The Guadalupian was previously known as the **Middle Permian**.
