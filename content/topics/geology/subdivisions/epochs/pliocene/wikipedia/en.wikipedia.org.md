excerpt: >-
  The **Pliocene** ( /ˈplaɪ.əsiːn, ˈplaɪ.oʊ-/ *PLY-ə-seen*, *PLY-oh-*; also Pleiocene) is the epoch in the geologic time scale that extends from 5.333 million to 2.58 million years ago. It is the second and most recent epoch of the [Neogene](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neogene/) Period in the [Cenozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenozoic/) Era. The Pliocene follows the [Miocene](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene/) Epoch and is followed by the [Pleistocene](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene/) Epoch. Prior to the 2009 revision of the geologic time scale, which placed the four most recent major glaciations entirely within the Pleistocene, the Pliocene also included the Gelasian Stage, which lasted from 2.588 to 1.806 million years ago, and is now included in the Pleistocene.
