excerpt: >-
  The **Paleoarchean** (/ˌpeɪlioʊ.ɑːrˈkiːən, ˌpæl-/ *PAY-lee-oh-ar-KEE-ən*, *PAL-*), also spelled **Palaeoarchaean** (formerly known as the early Archean), is a geologic era within the [Archean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean/) Eon. The name derives from Greek "Palaios" ancient. It spans the period of time 3,600 to 3,200 million years ago. The era is defined chronometrically and is not referenced to a specific level of a rock section on Earth. The earliest confirmed evidence of life comes from this era, and Vaalbara, one of Earth's earliest supercontinents, may have formed during this era.
