excerpt: >-
  The **Mesoproterozoic Era** is a geologic era that occurred from 1,600 to 1,000 million years ago. The Mesoproterozoic was the first era of [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/)'s history for which a fairly definitive geological record survives. Continents existed during the preceding era (the [Paleoproterozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoproterozoic/)), but little is known about them. The continental masses of the Mesoproterozoic were more or less the same ones that exist today, although their arrangement on the Earth's surface was different.
