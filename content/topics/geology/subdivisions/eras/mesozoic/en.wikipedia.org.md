excerpt: >-
  The **Mesozoic Era** is the second-to-last era of [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/)'s geological history, lasting from about 252 to 66 million years ago, comprising the [Triassic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triassic/), [Jurassic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic/) and [Cretaceous](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous/) Periods. It is characterized by the dominance of archosaurian reptiles, such as the dinosaurs; a hot greenhouse climate; and the tectonic break-up of [Pangaea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea/). The Mesozoic is the middle of the three eras since complex life evolved: the [Paleozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleozoic/), the Mesozoic, and the [Cenozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenozoic/).
