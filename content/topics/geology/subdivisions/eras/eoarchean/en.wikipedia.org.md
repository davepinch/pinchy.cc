  The **Eoarchean** (IPA: /ˌiːoʊ.ɑːrˈkiːən/ *EE-oh-ar-KEE-ən*; also spelled **Eoarchaean**) is the first era of the [Archean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean/) Eon of the geologic record. It spans 431 million years, from the end of the [Hadean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadean/) Eon 4031 Mya to the start of the [Paleoarchean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoarchean/) Era 3600 Mya. The beginnings of life on [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/) have been dated to this era and evidence of archaea and cyanobacteria date to 3500 Mya, comparatively shortly after the Eoarchean. At that time, the atmosphere was without oxygen and the pressure values ranged from 10 to 100 bar (around 10 to 100 times the atmospheric pressure today).
