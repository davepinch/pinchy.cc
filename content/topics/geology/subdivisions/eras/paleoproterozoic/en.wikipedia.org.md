  The **Paleoproterozoic Era** (also spelled Palaeoproterozoic) is the first of the three sub-divisions (eras) of the [Proterozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proterozoic/) eon, and also the longest era of the [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/)'s geological history, spanning from 2,500 to 1,600 million years ago (2.5–1.6 Ga). It is further subdivided into four geologic periods, namely the [Siderian](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siderian/), [Rhyacian](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhyacian/), [Orosirian](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orosirian/) and [Statherian](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statherian/).
