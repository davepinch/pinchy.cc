  The **Cenozoic** (/ˌsiːnəˈzoʊ.ɪk, ˌsɛn-/ SEE-nə-ZOH-ik, SEN-ə-; lit. 'new life') is [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/)'s current geological era, representing the last 66 million years of Earth's history. It is characterised by the dominance of mammals and angiosperms (flowering plants). It is the latest of three geological eras, preceded by the [Mesozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesozoic/) and [Paleozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleozoic/). The Cenozoic started with the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, when many species, including the non-avian dinosaurs, became extinct in an event attributed by most experts to the impact of a large asteroid or other celestial body, the Chicxulub impactor.
