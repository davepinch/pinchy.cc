  The **Statherian Period** ( /stəˈθɪəriən/; Ancient Greek: σταθερός, romanized: *statherós*, meaning "stable, firm") is the final geologic period in the [Paleoproterozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoproterozoic/) Era and lasted from 1800 Mya to 1600 Mya (million years ago). Instead of being based on stratigraphy, these dates are defined chronometrically.
