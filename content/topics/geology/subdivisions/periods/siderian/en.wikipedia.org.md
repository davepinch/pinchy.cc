  The **Siderian Period** ( /saɪˈdɪəri.ən, sɪ-/; Ancient Greek: σίδηρος, romanized: *sídēros*, meaning "iron") is the first geologic period in the [Paleoproterozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoproterozoic/) Era and lasted from 2500 Ma to 2300 Ma. Instead of being based on stratigraphy, these dates are defined chronometrically.
