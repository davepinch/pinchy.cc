  The **Cretaceous** (IPA: /krɪˈteɪʃəs/ krih-TAY-shəs) is a geological period that lasted from about 145 to 66 million years ago (Mya). It is the third and final period of the [Mesozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesozoic/) Era, as well as the longest. At around 79 million years, it is the longest geological period of the entire [Phanerozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanerozoic/). The name is derived from the Latin creta, "chalk", which is abundant in the latter half of the period. It is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation Kreide.
