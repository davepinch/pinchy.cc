  The **Triassic** (/traɪˈæsɪk/ *try-ASS-ik*; sometimes symbolized 🝈) is a geologic period and system which spans 50.5 million years from the end of the [Permian](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian/) Period 251.902 million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the [Jurassic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic/) Period 201.4 Mya. The Triassic is the first and shortest period of the [Mesozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesozoic/) Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic Period is subdivided into three epochs: Early Triassic, Middle Triassic and Late Triassic.
