  The **Ectasian Period** (from Ancient Greek: ἔκτασις, romanized: *éktasis*, meaning "extension") is the second geologic period in the [Mesoproterozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoproterozoic/) Era and lasted from 1400 Mya ago to 1200 Mya (million years ago). Instead of being based on stratigraphy, these dates are defined chronometrically.
