  The **Rhyacian Period** ( /raɪˈeɪsi.ən/; Ancient Greek: ῥύαξ, romanized: *rhýax*, meaning "stream of lava") is the second geologic period in the [Paleoproterozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoproterozoic/) Era and lasted from 2300 Mya to 2050 Mya (million years ago). Instead of being based on stratigraphy, these dates are defined chronometrically.
