excerpt: >-
  **Tertiary** (/ˈtɜːr.ʃə.ri, ˈtɜːr.ʃiˌɛr.i/ TUR-shə-ree, TUR-shee-err-ee) is an obsolete term for the geologic period from 66 million to 2.6 million years ago. The period began with the demise of the non-avian dinosaurs in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, at the start of the [Cenozoic Era](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenozoic/), and extended to the beginning of the Quaternary glaciation at the end of the [Pliocene](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliocene/) Epoch. The time span covered by the Tertiary has no exact equivalent in the current geologic time system, but it is essentially the merged Paleogene and Neogene periods, which are informally called the Early Tertiary and the Late Tertiary, respectively.
