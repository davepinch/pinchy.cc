  The **Quaternary** (/kwəˈtɜːrnəri, ˈkwɒtərnɛri/ *kwə-TUR-nə-ree*, *KWOT-ər-nerr-ee*) is the current and most recent of the three periods of the [Cenozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenozoic/) Era in the geologic time scale of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS). It follows the [Neogene](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neogene/) Period and spans from 2.58 million years ago to the present. As of 2023, the Quaternary Period is divided into two epochs: the [Pleistocene](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene/) (2.58 million years ago to 11.7 thousand years ago) and the [Holocene](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene/) (11.7 thousand years ago to today); a third epoch, the Anthropocene, has recently been proposed, but it is not officially recognised by the ICS.
