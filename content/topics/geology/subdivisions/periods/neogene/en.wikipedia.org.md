excerpt: >-
  The **Neogene** (/ˈniː.ədʒiːn/ NEE-ə-jeen, informally **Upper Tertiary** or **Late Tertiary**) is a geologic period and system that spans 20.45 million years from the end of the [Paleogene Period](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleogene/) 23.03 million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the present [Quaternary](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary/) Period 2.58 Mya. The Neogene is sub-divided into two epochs, the earlier [Miocene](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene/) and the later [Pliocene](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliocene/). Some geologists assert that the Neogene cannot be clearly delineated from the modern geological period, the Quaternary. The term "Neogene" was coined in 1853 by the Austrian palaeontologist Moritz Hörnes (1815–1868).
