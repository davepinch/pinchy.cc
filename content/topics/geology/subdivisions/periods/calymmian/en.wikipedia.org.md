  The **Calymmian Period** (from Ancient Greek: κάλυμμα, romanized: *kálymma*, meaning "cover") is the first geologic period in the [Mesoproterozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoproterozoic/) Era and lasted from 1600 Mya to 1400 Mya (million years ago). Instead of being based on stratigraphy, these dates are defined chronometrically.
