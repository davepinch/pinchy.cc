  The **Orosirian Period** ( /ˌɒroʊˈsɪəriən/; Ancient Greek: ὀροσειρά, romanized: *oroseirá*, meaning "mountain range") is the third geologic period in the [Paleoproterozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoproterozoic/) Era and lasted from 2050 Mya to 1800 Mya (million years ago). Instead of being based on stratigraphy, these dates are defined chronometrically.
