  The **Jurassic** (/dʒʊˈræsɪk/ juu-RASS-ik) is a geologic period and stratigraphic system that spanned from the end of the [Triassic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triassic/) Period 201.4 million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the [Cretaceous](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous/) Period, approximately 145 Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the [Mesozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesozoic/) Era and is named after the Jura Mountains, where limestone strata from the period were first identified.
