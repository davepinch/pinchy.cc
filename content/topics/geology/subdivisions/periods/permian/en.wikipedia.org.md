  The **Permian** (/ˈpɜːrmi.ən/ *PUR-mee-ən*) is a geologic period and stratigraphic system which spans 47 million years from the end of the [Carboniferous](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboniferous/) Period 298.9 million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the [Triassic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triassic/) Period 251.902 Mya. It is the last period of the [Paleozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleozoic/) Era; the following Triassic Period belongs to the [Mesozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesozoic/) Era. The concept of the Permian was introduced in 1841 by geologist Sir Roderick Murchison, who named it after the region of Perm in [Russia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia/).
