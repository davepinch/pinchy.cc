  The **Carboniferous** (/ˌkɑːrbəˈnɪfərəs/ KAR-bə-NIF-ər-əs) is a geologic period and system of the [Paleozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleozoic/) that spans 60 million years from the end of the [Devonian](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devonian/) Period 358.9 million years ago (mya), to the beginning of the [Permian](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian/) Period, 298.9 mya. In [North America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America/), the Carboniferous is often treated as two separate geological periods, the earlier Mississippian and the later [Pennsylvanian](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvanian_(geology)/).
