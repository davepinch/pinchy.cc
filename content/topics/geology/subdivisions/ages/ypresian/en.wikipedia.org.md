excerpt: >-
  In the geologic timescale the **Ypresian** is the oldest age or lowest stratigraphic stage of the [Eocene](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene/). It spans the time between 56 and 47.8 Ma, is preceded by the Thanetian Age (part of the [Paleocene](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene/)) and is followed by the [Eocene](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene/) Lutetian Age. The Ypresian is consistent with the lower Eocene.
