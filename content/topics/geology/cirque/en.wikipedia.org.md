excerpt: >-
  A **cirque** (French: [siʁk]; from the Latin word *circus*) is an amphitheatre-like valley formed by glacial erosion. Alternative names for this landform are **corrie** (from Scottish Gaelic: coire, meaning a pot or cauldron) and **cwm** (Welsh for 'valley'; pronounced [kʊm]). A cirque may also be a similarly shaped landform arising from fluvial erosion.
