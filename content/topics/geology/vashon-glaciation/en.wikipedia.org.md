excerpt: >-
  The **Vashon Glaciation**, **Vashon Stadial** or **Vashon Stade** is a local term for the most recent period of very cold climate in which during its peak, glaciers covered the entire [Salish Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salish_Sea/) as well as present day [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle/), [Tacoma](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma,_Washington/), [Olympia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia,_Washington/) and other surrounding areas in the western part of present-day [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/) of the [United States of America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States/). This occurred during a cold period around the world known as the last glacial period. This was the most recent cold period of the Quaternary glaciation, the time period in which the arctic ice sheets have existed. The Quaternary Glaciation is part of the Late Cenozoic Ice Age, which began 33.9 million years ago and is ongoing. It is the time period in which the Antarctic ice cap has existed.
