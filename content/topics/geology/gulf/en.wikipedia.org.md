excerpt: >-
  A **gulf** is a large inlet from an ocean into a landmass, typically (though not always) with a narrower opening than a bay. The term was used traditionally for large, highly indented navigable bodies of salt water that are enclosed by the coastline. Many gulfs are major shipping areas, such as the [Persian Gulf](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf/), [Gulf of Mexico](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico/), Gulf of Finland, and Gulf of Aden.
