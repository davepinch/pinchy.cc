  This field-trip guide explores the main source region of  the CRBG and is written for trip participants attending the 2017 International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earthâ€™s Interior (IAVCEI) Scientific Assembly in Portland, Oregon, USA. The first part of the guide provides an overview of the geologic features common in the CRFBP and the stratigraphic terminology used in the CRBG. The accompanying road log examines the stratigraphic evolution, eruption history, and structure of the province through a field examination of the lavas, dikes, and pyroclastic rocks of the CRBG
