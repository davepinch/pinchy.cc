title: "Bald Hill, northwest of Monroe, consists primarily of andesite flows. These blue-green porphyritic rocks weather quite readily to a light grey material with a reddish hue which can easily be disintegrated by hand. At several localities on Bald Hill vertical dikes are exposed which contain andesite xenoliths in a fine grained matrix."
