excerpt: >-
  **Diatomaceous earth** (/ˌdaɪ.ətəˈmeɪʃəs/ *DY-ə-tə-MAY-shəs*), also known as **diatomite** (/daɪˈætəmaɪt/ dy-AT-ə-myte), **celite**, or **kieselguhr**, is a naturally occurring, soft, siliceous sedimentary rock that can be crumbled into a fine white to off-white powder. It has a particle size ranging from more than 3 mm to less than 1 μm, but typically 10 to 200 μm. Depending on the granularity, this powder can have an abrasive feel, similar to pumice powder, and has a low density as a result of its high porosity. The typical chemical composition of oven-dried diatomaceous earth is 80–90% silica, with 2–4% alumina (attributed mostly to clay minerals), and 0.5–2% iron oxide.
