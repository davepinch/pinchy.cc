excerpt: >-
  In geology, a **terrane** (/təˈreɪn, ˈtɛreɪn/; in full, a **tectonostratigraphic terrane**) is a crust fragment formed on a tectonic plate (or broken off from it) and accreted or "sutured" to crust lying on another plate. The crustal block or fragment preserves its distinctive geologic history, which is different from the surrounding areas—hence the term "exotic" terrane. The suture zone between a terrane and the crust it attaches to is usually identifiable as a fault. A sedimentary deposit that buries the contact of the terrane with adjacent rock is called an **overlap formation**. An igneous intrusion that has intruded and obscured the contact of a terrane with adjacent rock is called a stitching pluton.
