excerpt: >-
  **Basalt** (UK: /ˈbæsɔːlt, -əlt/; US: /bəˈsɔːlt, ˈbeɪsɔːlt/) is an aphanitic (fine-grained) extrusive igneous rock formed from the rapid cooling of low-viscosity lava rich in magnesium and iron (mafic lava) exposed at or very near the surface of a rocky planet or moon. More than 90% of all volcanic rock on [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) is basalt. Rapid-cooling, fine-grained basalt is chemically equivalent to slow-cooling, coarse-grained gabbro. The eruption of basalt lava is observed by geologists at about 20 volcanoes per year. Basalt is also an important rock type on other planetary bodies in the [Solar System](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System). For example, the bulk of the plains of [Venus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus), which cover ~80% of the surface, are basaltic; the lunar maria are plains of flood-basaltic lava flows; and basalt is a common rock on the surface of [Mars](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars).
