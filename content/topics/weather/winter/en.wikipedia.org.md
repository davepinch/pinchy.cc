  **Winter** is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate climates. It occurs after autumn and before spring. The tilt of [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth)'s axis causes seasons; winter occurs when a hemisphere is oriented away from the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun). Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.
