excerpt: >-
  **Autumn**, also known as **fall** in American English and Canadian English, is one of the four temperate seasons on [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/). Outside the tropics, autumn marks the transition from [summer](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer/) to [winter](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter/), in September (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere). Autumn is the season when the duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably. Day length decreases and night length increases as the season progresses until the Winter Solstice in December (Northern Hemisphere) and June (Southern Hemisphere). One of its main features in temperate climates is the striking change in colour for the leaves of deciduous trees as they prepare to shed.
