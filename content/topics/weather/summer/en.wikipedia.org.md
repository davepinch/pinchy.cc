excerpt: >-
  **Summer** is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, occurring after [spring](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(season)) and before [autumn](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn). At or centred on the summer solstice, daylight hours are longest and darkness hours are shortest, with day length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The earliest sunrises and latest sunsets also occur near the date of the solstice. The date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate, tradition, and culture. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
