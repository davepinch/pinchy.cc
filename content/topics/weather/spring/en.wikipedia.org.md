excerpt: >-
  **Spring**, also known as **springtime**, is one of the four temperate seasons, succeeding [winter](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter/) and preceding [summer](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer/). There are various technical definitions of spring, but local usage of the term varies according to local climate, cultures and customs. When it is spring in the Northern Hemisphere, it is [autumn](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn/) in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. At the spring (or vernal) equinox, days and nights are approximately twelve hours long, with daytime length increasing and nighttime length decreasing as the season progresses until the Summer Solstice in June (Northern Hemisphere) and December (Southern Hemisphere).
