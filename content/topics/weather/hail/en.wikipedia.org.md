excerpt: >-
  **Hail** is a form of solid [precipitation](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation/). It is distinct from ice pellets (American English "sleet"), though the two are often confused. It consists of balls or irregular lumps of ice, each of which is called a hailstone. Ice pellets generally fall in cold weather, while hail growth is greatly inhibited during low surface temperatures.
