  Many amateur astronomers still choose to fabricate their own instruments, for the pride of accomplishment, the gaining of knowledge and the insurance of quality. Telescope making is at the heart of the Springfield Telescope Makers - after all it is two thirds of our club's name - and on these pages we hope to show you that you too can make your own telescope - and it can be an excellent performer!
