excerpt: >-
  I have been writing short-form and serial science fiction for most of this millennium. I am the author of supernatural thriller novel There Is No Antimemetics Division, which is about monstrous, invasive ideas from beyond the human ideatic ecology. Antimemetics was recently picked up for traditional publication by Penguin Random House â€” look out for it in the fourth quarter of 2025!
