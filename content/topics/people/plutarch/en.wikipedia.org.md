**Plutarch** (/ˈpluːtɑːrk/; Greek: Πλούταρχος, *Ploútarchos*; Koinē Greek: [ˈplúːtarkʰos]; c. AD 46 – after AD 119) was a Greek Middle Platonist philosopher, historian, biographer, essayist, and priest at the Temple of Apollo in Delphi. He is known primarily for his *Parallel Lives*, a series of biographies of illustrious Greeks and Romans, and *Moralia*, a collection of essays and speeches. Upon becoming a Roman citizen, he was possibly named **Lucius Mestrius Plutarchus** (Λούκιος Μέστριος Πλούταρχος).
