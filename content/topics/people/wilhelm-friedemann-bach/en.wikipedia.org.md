**Wilhelm Friedemann Bach** (22 November 1710 â€“ 1 July 1784) was a German composer, organist and harpsichordist. He was the second child and eldest son of [Johann Sebastian Bach](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach) and Maria Barbara Bach. Despite his acknowledged genius as an improviser and composer, his income and employment were unstable, and he died in poverty.
