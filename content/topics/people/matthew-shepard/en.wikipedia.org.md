**Matthew Wayne Shepard** (December 1, 1976 â€“ October 12, 1998) was a gay American student at the University of Wyoming who was beaten, tortured, and left to die near Laramie on the night of October 6, 1998. He was taken by rescuers to Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, [Colorado](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado), where he died six days later from severe head injuries received during the attack.
