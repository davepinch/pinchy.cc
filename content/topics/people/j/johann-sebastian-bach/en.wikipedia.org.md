  **Johann Sebastian Bach** (31 March [O.S. 21 March] 1685 â€“ 28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the late Baroque period. He is known for his orchestral music such as the *Brandenburg Concertos*; instrumental compositions such as the Cello Suites; keyboard works such as the *Goldberg Variations* and *The Well-Tempered Clavier*; organ works such as the *Schubler Chorales* and the Toccata and Fugue in D minor; and vocal music such as the *St Matthew Passion* and the Mass in B minor. Since the 19th-century Bach revival, he has been generally regarded as one of the greatest composers in the history of Western music.
