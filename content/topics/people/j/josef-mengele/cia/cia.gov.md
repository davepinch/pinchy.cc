title: "Paraguay-Latin America: The Case of Dr. Mengele (PDF) (cia.gov)"
excerpt: >-
  The search for German war criminal Josef Mengele has centered on South America, long a haven for Nazi fugitives. Paraguay has been a special target for investigators. Mengele reportedly lived there during the early 1960s, and some Nazi hunters believe he still resides in Paraguay under official protection. Mengele, a physician, is accused of selecting tens of thousands of inmates at the Auschwitz concentration camp for medical experiments or extermination in gas chambers.
hideout of: Josef Mengele
mention of:
  - Paraguay
  - South America
note: This CIA report was written in February 15, 1985 under secret classification (it was released to the public in 2023). At the time, Mengele's location and status was unknown. In fact, he had been dead for about a week when the report was first published. It would be interesting to review the report in depth to see if the CIA got it right. The Alfredo Stroessner mentioned in the document was overthrown in 1989.
