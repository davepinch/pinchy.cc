  The first recorded death was noted on May 22, 1853, when settlers discovered the body of Judah Church in the woods of his claim near Oak Harbor. A coroner's inquest was hastily convened at the site—official verdict, "unknown"—and the sixty-three-year-old native of Michigan was buried where he was found.
