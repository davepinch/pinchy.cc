  Haden, John Miller (1825â€“1892).

After attending Jackson College at Columbia, Tennessee, he graduated from La Grange College (Alabama) and in 1847 received his M.D. degree from the Medical College of the University of New Orleans. President James K. Polk commissioned him assistant surgeon in the United States Army in December 1847; Haden was assigned to duty under Gen. Winfield Scott and was with him at the fall of Veracruz. He remained in the army after the Mexican War as medical officer in the party that escorted the civil officials of Oregon Territory to their posts.

In 1864 he became chief of the medical bureau of the Trans-Mississippi Department, the headquarters of which were at Marshall, Texas.
