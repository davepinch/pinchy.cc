title: "Frederick the Great of Prussiaâ€™s Eulogy on Julien Offray de la Mettrie (marxists.org)"
eulogy of:
  - Julien Offray de La Mettrie
  - Frederick the Great
excerpt: >-
  Julien Offray de la Mettrie was born in Saint Malo, on the twenty-fifth of December, 1709, to Julien Offray de la Mettrie and Marie Gaudron, who were living by a trade large enough to provide a good education for their son. They sent him to the college of Coutance to study the humanities; he went from there to Paris, to the college of Plessis; he studied his rhetoric at Caen, and since he had much genius and imagination, he won all the prizes for eloquence. He was a born orator and was passionately fond of poetry and belles-lettres, but his father thought he would earn more as an ecclesiastic than as a poet, and destined him for the church. He sent him, the following year, to the college of Plessis where he studied logic under M. Cordier, who was more a Jansenist than a logician.
