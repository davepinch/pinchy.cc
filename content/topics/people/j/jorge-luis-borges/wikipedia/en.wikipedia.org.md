  **Jorge Francisco Isidoro Luis Borges Acevedo** (/ˈbɔːrhɛs/ BOR-hess; Spanish: [ˈxoɾxe ˈlwis ˈboɾxes]; 24 August 1899 – 14 June 1986) was an Argentine short-story writer, essayist, poet and translator regarded as a key figure in Spanish-language and international literature. His best-known works, *Ficciones* (transl. *Fictions*) and *El Aleph* (transl. *The Aleph*), published in the 1940s, are collections of short stories exploring motifs such as dreams, labyrinths, chance, infinity, archives, mirrors, fictional writers and mythology. Borges's works have contributed to philosophical literature and the fantasy genre, and have had a major influence on the magic realist movement in 20th century Latin American literature.
