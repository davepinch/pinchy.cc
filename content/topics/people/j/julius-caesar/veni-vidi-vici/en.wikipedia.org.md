  ***Veni, vidi, vici*** (Classical Latin: [ˈu̯eːniː ˈu̯iːd̪iː ˈu̯iː.kiː], Ecclesiastical Latin: [ˈveːni ˈviːd̪i ˈviː.t͡ʃi]; "I came; I saw; I conquered") is a Latin phrase used to refer to a swift, conclusive victory. The phrase is popularly attributed to [Julius Caesar](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar/) who, according to Appian, used the phrase in a letter to the Roman Senate around 47 BC after he had achieved a quick victory in his short war against Pharnaces II of Pontus at the Battle of Zela (modern-day Zile, Turkey).
