  **Paul Joseph Goebbels** (German: [ˈpaʊ̯l ˈjoːzɛf ˈɡœbl̩s]; 29 October 1897 – 1 May 1945) was a German Nazi politician and philologist who was the *Gauleiter* (district leader) of Berlin, chief propagandist for the Nazi Party, and then Reich Minister of Propaganda from 1933 to 1945. He was one of Adolf Hitler's closest and most devoted followers, known for his skills in public speaking and his virulent antisemitism which was evident in his publicly voiced views.
