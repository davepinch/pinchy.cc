  **Zhuang Zhou** (/dʒuˈɑːŋ ˈdʒoʊ/), commonly known as **Zhuangzi** (/ˈdʒwɑːŋˈdzʌ/; Chinese: 莊子; literally "Master Zhuang"; also rendered in the Wade–Giles romanization as **Chuang Tzu**), was an influential Chinese philosopher who lived around the 4th century BCE during the Warring States period, a period of great development in Chinese philosophy, the Hundred Schools of Thought. He is credited with writing—in part or in whole—a work known by his name, the Zhuangzi, which is one of two foundational texts of Taoism, alongside the Tao Te Ching.
