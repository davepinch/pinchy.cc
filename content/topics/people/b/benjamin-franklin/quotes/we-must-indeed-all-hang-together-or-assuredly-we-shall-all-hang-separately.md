  Statement at the signing of the Declaration of Independence (1776-07-04), quoted as an anecdote in *The Works of Benjamin Franklin* by Jared Sparks (1840). However, this had earlier been attributed to Richard Penn in *Memoirs of a Life, Chiefly Passed in Pennsylvania, Within the Last Sixty Years* (1811, p. 116). In 1801, "If we don't hang together, by Heavens we shall hang separately" appears in the English play *Life* by Frederick Reynolds (*Life*, Frederick Reynolds, in a collection by Mrs Inchbald, 1811, Google Books first published in 1801), and the remark was later attributed to 'An American General' by Reynolds in his 1826 memoir p.358. A comparable pun on "hang alone … hang together" appears in Dryden's 1717 *The Spanish Fryar*. The pun also appears in an April 14, 1776 letter from Carter Braxton to Landon Carter,Letters of Members of the Continental Congress, Vol.1 (1921), p.421, as "a true saying of a Wit — We must hang together or separately."
