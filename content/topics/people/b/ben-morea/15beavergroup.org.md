excerpt: >-
  In the late 1960s, Ben Morea was the notorious leader of an unsavory Lower East Side anarchist collective called Up Against the Wall, Motherfucker. As a young historian who studies that period, I’d spent almost three years trying to locate him. All the leads I’d followed went nowhere. It was as if Morea had vanished, every bit as thoroughly as a jet contrail.
