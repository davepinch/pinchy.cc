  **Herman Melville** (born **Melvill**; August 1, 1819 â€“ September 28, 1891) was an American novelist, short story writer, and poet of the American Renaissance period. Among his best-known works are *Moby-Dick* (1851); *Typee* (1846), a romanticized account of his experiences in Polynesia; and *Billy Budd, Sailor*, a posthumously published novella. Although his reputation was not high at the time of his death, the 1919 centennial of his birth was the starting point of a Melville revival, and *Moby-Dick* grew to be considered one of the great American novels.
