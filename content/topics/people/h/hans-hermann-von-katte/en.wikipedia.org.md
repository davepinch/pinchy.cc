excerpt: >-
  **Hans Hermann von Katte** (28 February 1704 â€“ 6 November 1730) was a Lieutenant of the Prussian Army, and a friend, tutor and possible lover of the future [King Frederick II](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_the_Great) of Prussia, who was at the time the Crown Prince. Katte was executed by Frederick's father, the Prussian King Frederick William I, when Frederick plotted to escape from Prussia to Britain. It was possible that Frederick intended to defect to the service of the British King George II (his maternal uncle) and possibly return to Prussia to depose his father.
