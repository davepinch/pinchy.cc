excerpt: >-
  **Stephen Grover Cleveland** (March 18, 1837 – June 24, 1908) was an American politician who served as the 22nd and 24th [president of the United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States/) from 1885 to 1889 and from 1893 to 1897. He is the only U.S. president to serve non-consecutive presidential terms. Cleveland was the first Democrat to win the presidency after the Civil War, and was one of two Democratic presidents, followed by Woodrow Wilson in 1912, in an era when Republicans dominated the presidency between 1869 and 1933. He won the popular vote in three presidential elections—1884, 1888, and 1892. Benjamin Harrison won the electoral college vote, and thus the presidency, in 1888.
