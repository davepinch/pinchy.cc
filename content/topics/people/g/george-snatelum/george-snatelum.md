title: "George Snatelum"
note: >-
  This is a placeholder record until more research is conducted. August Valentine Kautz said "George Sna-te-lum is chief of the Skagits" (1853). The Treaty of Point Elliott lists "Kwuss-ka-nam, or George Snatelum, Sen., Skagit tribe" and "Hel-mits, or George Snatelum, Skagit sub-chief" (1855). It is not established whether these are related.
