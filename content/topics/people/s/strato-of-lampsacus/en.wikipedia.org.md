  **Strato of Lampsacus** (/ˈstreɪtoʊ/; Greek: Στράτων ὁ Λαμψακηνός, translit. Strátōn ho Lampsakēnós, c. 335 – c. 269 BCE) was a Peripatetic philosopher, and the third director (scholarch) of the Lyceum after the death of [Theophrastus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophrastus/). He devoted himself especially to the study of natural science, and increased the naturalistic elements in [Aristotle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle/)'s thought to such an extent, that he denied the need for an active god to construct the universe, preferring to place the government of the universe in the unconscious force of nature alone.
