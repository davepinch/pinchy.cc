  **Saint Peter** (born 1 BC as **Shimon Bar Yonah**; died AD 64–68), also known as **Peter the Apostle**, **Simon Peter**, **Simeon**, **Simon**, or **Cephas**, was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus and one of the first leaders of the early Christian Church. He appears repeatedly and prominently in all four New Testament gospels, as well as the Acts of the Apostles. Catholic and Orthodox tradition treats Peter as the first bishop of Rome – or pope – and also as the first bishop of Antioch.
