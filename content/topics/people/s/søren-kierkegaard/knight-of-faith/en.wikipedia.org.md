concept of: Søren Kierkegaard (Wikipedia)
excerpt: >-
  The **knight of faith** (Danish: *troens ridder*) is an individual who has placed complete faith in himself and in God and can act freely and independently from the world. The 19th-century Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard vicariously discusses the knight of faith in several of his pseudonymic works, with the most in-depth and detailed critique exposited in *Fear and Trembling* and in *Repetition*.
