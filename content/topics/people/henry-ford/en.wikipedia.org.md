      Also in 1896, Ford attended a meeting of Edison executives, where he was introduced to [Thomas Edison](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison). Edison approved of Ford's automobile experimentation. Encouraged by Edison, Ford designed and built a second vehicle, completing it in 1898.

      In [Aldous Huxley](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley)'s [Brave New World](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World) (1932), society is organized on "Fordist" lines, the years are dated A.F. or Anno Ford ("In the Year of Ford"), and the expression "My Ford" is used instead of "My Lord". The Christian cross is replaced with a capital "T" for Model-T.
