  **Émile Édouard Charles Antoine Zola** (/ˈzoʊlə/, also US: /zoʊˈlɑː/, French: [emil zɔla]; 2 April 1840 – 29 September 1902) was a French novelist, journalist, playwright, the best-known practitioner of the literary school of naturalism, and an important contributor to the development of theatrical naturalism. He was a major figure in the political liberalization of [France](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France/) and in the exoneration of the falsely accused and convicted army officer Alfred Dreyfus, which is encapsulated in his renowned newspaper opinion headlined *J'Accuse…!*  Zola was nominated for the first and second Nobel Prize in Literature in 1901 and 1902.
