excerpt: >-
  **Elvis Aaron Presley** (January 8, 1935 â€“ August 16, 1977), commonly referred to by his first name, **Elvis**, was an American singer and actor. Known as the "King of Rock and Roll", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Presley's energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, brought both great success and initial controversy.
