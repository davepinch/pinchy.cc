excerpt: >-
  Elizabeth Siddal began her career as a model for members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, an artistic group that secretly formed in 1848. The fact that she was determined to become an artist herself is testament to her bold spirit and determination. For twenty years I have studied her, read about her, and endeavored to excavate successive layers of concrete knowledge to discover who she truly was.
