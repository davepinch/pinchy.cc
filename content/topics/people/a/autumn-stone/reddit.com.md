  It was the last balmy Friday of August, and Green Lake Park in Seattle was bustling with families enjoying the late summer sunshine. The park, located in a dense urban area in the north end of the city, features a large lake ringed by a 2.8-mile bike path as well as multiple playfields, a boathouse, and several docks that are popular amongst fishermen and swimmers.
