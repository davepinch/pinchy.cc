  **Irwin Allen Ginsberg** (/ˈɡɪnzbɜːrɡ/; June 3, 1926 – April 5, 1997) was an American poet and writer. As a student at Columbia University in the 1940s, he began friendships with [William S. Burroughs](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Burroughs) and [Jack Kerouac](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kerouac/), forming the core of the Beat Generation. He vigorously opposed militarism, economic materialism, and sexual repression, and he embodied various aspects of this counterculture with his views on drugs, sex, multiculturalism, hostility to bureaucracy, and openness to Eastern religions.
