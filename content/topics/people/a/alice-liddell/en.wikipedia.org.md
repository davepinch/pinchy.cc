excerpt: >-
  **Alice Pleasance Hargreaves** (née Liddell, /ˈlɪdəl/; 4 May 1852 – 16 November 1934) was an English woman who, in her childhood, was an acquaintance and photography subject of [Lewis Carroll](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll/). One of the stories he told her during a boating trip became the classic 1865 children's novel *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*. She shared her name with "Alice", the story's protagonist, but scholars disagree about the extent to which the character was based upon her.
