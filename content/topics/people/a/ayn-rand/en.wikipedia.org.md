  **Alice O'Connor** (born **Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum**; February 2 [O.S. January 20], 1905 – March 6, 1982), better known by her pen name **Ayn Rand** (/aɪn/), was a Russian-born American writer and philosopher. She is known for her fiction and for developing a philosophical system she named Objectivism. Born and educated in [Russia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia/), she moved to the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States/) in 1926. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful and two Broadway plays, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, *The Fountainhead*. In 1957, Rand published her best-known work, the novel *Atlas Shrugged*. Afterward, until her death in 1982, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays.
