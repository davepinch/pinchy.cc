excerpt: >-
  In 1999, inspired by the remarkable success of the Human Genome Project, the OSU Libraries Special Collections launched an ambitious undertaking that seeks to closely document virtually every day of Linus and Ava Helen Pauling's lives. The result is Linus Pauling Day-by-Day, a constantly expanding resource that provides in-depth description for a substantial portion of the half-million item Ava Helen and Linus Pauling Papers.
