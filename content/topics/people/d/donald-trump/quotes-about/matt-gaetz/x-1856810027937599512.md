statement: >-
  It is my Great Honor to announce that Congressman Matt Gaetz, of Florida, is 
  hereby nominated to be The Attorney General of the United States. Matt is a 
  deeply gifted and tenacious attorney, trained at the William & Mary College of 
  Law, who has distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving 
  desperately needed reform at the Department of Justice. Few issues in America 
  are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice 
  System. Matt will end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle 
  Criminal Organizations and restore Americans' badly-shattered Faith and 
  Confidence in the Justice Department. On the House Judiciary Committee, which 
  performs oversight of DOJ, Matt played a key role in defeating the Russia, 
  Russia, Russia Hoax, and exposing alarming and systemic Government 
  Corruption and Weaponization. He is a Champion for the Constitution and the 
  Rule of Law. Matt will root out the systemic corruption at DOJ, and return the 
  Department to its true mission of fighting Crime, and upholding our Democracy 
  and Constitution. We must have Honesty, Integrity, and Transparency at DOJ. 
  Under Matt's leadership, all Americans will be proud of the Department of Justice 
  once again.
