title: "Isaac N. Ebey, letter to his brother Winfield S. Ebey, regarding life at his property near Port Townsend, and the possible formation of a new Territory, April 20, 1853 (digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu)"
excerpt: >-
  Isaac N. Ebey writes to his brother Winfield S. Ebey to tell him about his life at his property near Port Townsend.  He mentions waiting to hear word from the U.S. Congress regarding the possible formation of a separate northern territory (Washington Territory).  Isaac discusses the growth of crops on his land, including potatoes, barley and wheat.  Isaac also mentions that milk cows and oxen are expensive.  Isaac asks Winfield if he has received any of the newspapers that he has purchased subscriptions to for him, including the "Columbian" and the "Statesman."  He points out that the land Donation Act has been renewed by Congress and tells his brother that he should move to the territory next year.  He promises to send more money to Winfield and explains that any gap in sending money is due to Isaac's spending on his own family and paying off old debts.  He observes that many ships have passed through the Puget Sound and predicts that the area will be known for its commerce soon.
