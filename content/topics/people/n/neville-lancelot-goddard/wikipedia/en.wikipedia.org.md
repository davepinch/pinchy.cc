  **Neville Goddard** (February 19, 1905 â€“ October 1, 1972), was a Barbadian writer, speaker and mystic. He grew up in Barbados and moved to the United States as a young adult. He taught various self-help methods for testing his own claim that the human imagination is omnificent, therefore God. He achieved popularity by reinterpreting the Bible and the poetry of William Blake.
