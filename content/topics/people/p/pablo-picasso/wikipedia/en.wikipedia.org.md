  **Pablo Ruiz Picasso** (25 October 1881 – 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France. One of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist *Les Demoiselles d'Avignon* (1907), and the anti-war painting *Guernica* (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War.
