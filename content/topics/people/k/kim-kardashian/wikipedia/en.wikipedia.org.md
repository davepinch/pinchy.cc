  **Kimberly Noel Kardashian** (born October 21, 1980) is an American media personality, socialite, and businesswoman. She first gained media attention as a friend and stylist of Paris Hilton, but received wider notice after the sex tape *Kim Kardashian, Superstar*, which she filmed in 2003 with her then-boyfriend Ray J, was released in 2007. Later that year, she and her family began to appear on the E! reality television series *Keeping Up with the Kardashians*, which aired until 2021. Its success led to the formation of three spin-off shows; *Kourtney and Kim Take New York* (2011–2012), *Kourtney and Kim Take Miami* (2009–2013) and Hulu's *The Kardashians* (2022–present).
