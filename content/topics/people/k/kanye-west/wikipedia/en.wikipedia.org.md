West's debut studio album, *The College Dropout* (2004), was met with critical acclaim and yielded the *Billboard* Hot 100-number one single "Slow Jamz". He peaked the chart on four other occasions with the singles "Gold Digger" (2005), "Stronger" (2007), "E.T." (2011, as a featured artist), and "Carnival" (2024).
