  **Thomas Fuller** (baptised 19 June 1608 â€“ 16 August 1661) was an English churchman and historian. He is now remembered for his writings, particularly his *Worthies of England*, published in 1662, after his death. He was a prolific author, and one of the first English writers able to live by his pen (and his many patrons).
