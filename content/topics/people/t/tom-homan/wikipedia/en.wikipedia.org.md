  **Thomas Douglas Homan** (born November 28, 1961) is an American former police officer, immigration official, and political commentator who served during Barack Obama's presidency and the first Trump Administration. He served as acting director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from January 30, 2017, to June 29, 2018. He advocates deportation and opposes sanctuary city policies. Within the Trump administration, he was among the most strident proponents of separating children from their parents as a means of deterring illegal entry into the country and curbing human trafficking. Since his retirement from government, he has been a Fox News contributor. Homan will serve as Trump's "border czar" during Trump’s second presidency.
