title: "Does this seem accurate? Writing a paper on Texas masculinity."
donald trump of: Ted Cruz
excerpt: "top comment from delugetheory: *That is a pretty accurate representation of the relationship between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, but as a self-respecting Texan male, I would please ask that Ted Cruz not be made the representative of all Texan males. His behavior stems from the fact that he is a modern Republican politician, not from the fact that his parents moved to Texas when he was a child.*"
