  **Thomas Jefferson** (April 13, 1743[b] â€“ July 4, 1826) was an American statesman, diplomat, lawyer, architect, philosopher, and Founding Father who served as the third president of the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States/) from 1801 to 1809. He was the primary author of the [Declaration of Independence](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence/). Following the American Revolutionary War and prior to becoming president in 1801, Jefferson was the nation's first U.S. secretary of state under [George Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington/) and then the nation's second vice president under John Adams. Jefferson was a leading proponent of democracy, republicanism, and individual rights, and produced formative documents and decisions at the state, national, and international levels. His writings and advocacy for human rights, including freedom of thought, speech, and religion, served as substantial inspirations to the American Revolution and subsequent Revolutionary War in which the Thirteen Colonies succeeded in breaking from British America and establishing the United States as a sovereign nation.
