  In early 1989, Khomeini issued a fatwā (juristic ruling) calling for the assassination of Salman Rushdie, an India-born British author. Rushdie's book, *The Satanic Verses*, published in 1988, was alleged to commit blasphemy against Islam. Khomeini's fatwā required not only Rushdie's execution, but of "all those involved in the publication" of the book.
