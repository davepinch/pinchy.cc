title: "The origins of 60-Hz as a power frequency (ieeexplore.ieee.org)"
author: E. L. Owen
excerpt: >-
  In 1891, Westinghouse engineers in Pittsburgh selected 60 Hz as their new power frequency. That same year, AEG engineers in Berlin selected 50 Hz as their new power frequency. Although much has happened since 1891, these two frequencies remain the principal power frequencies in use worldwide. Many people continue to be affected by the decisions on frequency standards made so very long ago. The author discusses the origins of 60 Hz as the power frequency now used in the USA. The author covers the work of Charles Scott, Benjamin Lamme and L.B. Stillwell of Westinghouse, the experimental period of 1821 to 1880, the light period from 1880 to 1890, the power and period of 1890 to 1925, and the period of systems interconnection from 1925 to 1990. Particular emphasis is given to the development of frequency for lighting systems and of frequency development in the USA, Europe and Japan.
