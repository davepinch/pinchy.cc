title: "[Why does FM sound better than AM?] Someone gave me an analogy some time ago that made a lot of sense. If you shine a flashlight through a tree blowing in the wind and vary the brightness to convey information, the signal can get distorted pretty easily. However, if you have a constant brightness source and vary the color, itâ€™s a lot easier to figure out what the source is trying to convey."
