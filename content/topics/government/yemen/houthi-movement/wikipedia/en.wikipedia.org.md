excerpt: >-
  The **Houthi movement** (/ˈhuːθi/; Arabic: الحوثيون, romanized: al-Ḥūthiyūn [al.ħuː.θi.juːn]), officially the **Ansar Allah Movement**, is a Zaydi Shia Islamist political and military organization that emerged from Yemen in the 1990s. It is predominantly made up of Zaidi Shias, with their namesake leadership being drawn largely from the Houthi tribe. The group has been a central player in Yemen's civil war, drawing widespread international condemnation for its human rights abuses, including targeting civilians and using child soldiers. The movement is designated as a terrorist organization by some countries.
