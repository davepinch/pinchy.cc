***Just Do It*** or **JDI** for short is a trademark of shoe company Nike. The slogan was coined in 1988 at an advertising agency meeting. The founder of the Wieden+Kennedy agency, Dan Wieden, credits the inspiration for his "Just Do It" Nike slogan to death row Gary Gilmoreâ€™s last words: "Let's do it." From 1988 to 1998, Nike increased its share of the North American domestic sport-shoe business from 18% to 43% (from $877 million to $9.2 billion in worldwide sales). In many Nike-related situations, "Just Do It" appears alongside the Nike logo, known as the Swoosh.
