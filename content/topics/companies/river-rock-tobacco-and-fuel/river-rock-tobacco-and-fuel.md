A prominent gas station outside [Arlington](/arlington/) at exit 210 on [Interstate 5](/interstate-5/) (236th Street NE). I usually stopped here when commuting between [Seattle](/seattle/) and [Bellingham](/bellingham/). They have a good selection of products with plenty of space to park. The employees are nice.
