excerpt: >-
  **Pangaea** or **Pangea** (/pænˈdʒiː.ə/) was a supercontinent that existed during the late [Paleozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleozoic/) and early [Mesozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesozoic/) eras. It assembled from the earlier continental units of Gondwana, Euramerica and Siberia during the [Carboniferous](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboniferous/) approximately 335 million years ago, and began to break apart about 200 million years ago, at the end of the [Triassic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triassic/) and beginning of the [Jurassic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic/). In contrast to the present [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/) and its distribution of continental mass, Pangaea was centred on the equator and surrounded by the superocean [Panthalassa](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthalassa/) and the Paleo-Tethys and subsequent Tethys Oceans. Pangaea is the most recent supercontinent to have existed and the first to be reconstructed by geologists.
