excerpt: >-
  **North America** is a [continent](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent/) in the Northern Hemisphere and almost entirely within the Western Hemisphere. It is bordered to the north by the [Arctic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Ocean/), to the east by the [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean/), to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea, and to the west and south by the [Pacific Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean/). Because it is on the North American Tectonic Plate, Greenland is included as a part of North America geographically.
