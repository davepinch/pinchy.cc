excerpt: >-
  The **Fitzgerald Theater** is the oldest active theatre in [Saint Paul](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Paul,_Minnesota/), [Minnesota](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota/), and the home of American Public Media's *Live from Here* (formerly *A Prairie Home Companion*). It was one of many theaters built by the Shubert Theatre Corporation, and was initially named the Sam S. Shubert Theater. It was designed by the noted [Chicago](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago/) architectural firm of Marshall and Fox, architects of several theaters for the Shuberts. In 1933, it became a movie outlet known as the World Theater. The space was purchased by Minnesota Public Radio in 1980, restored with a stage in 1986 as a site for Prairie Home, and renamed in 1994 after St. Paul native F. Scott Fitzgerald.
