  **Kosovo**, officially the **Republic of Kosovo**, is a country in [Southeast Europe](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Europe/) with partial diplomatic recognition. Kosovo lies landlocked in the centre of the Balkans, bordered by [Serbia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia/) to the north and east, [North Macedonia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Macedonia/) to the southeast, [Albania](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania/) to the southwest, and [Montenegro](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro/) to the west.
