  **Kosovo**, officially the **Republic of Kosovo**, is a country in [Southeast Europe](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Europe/) with partial diplomatic recognition. Kosovo lies landlocked in the centre of the Balkans, bordered by [Serbia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia/) to the north and east, [North Macedonia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Macedonia/) to the southeast, [Albania](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania/) to the southwest, and [Montenegro](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro/) to the west. Most of central Kosovo sits on the plains of Metohija and the Kosovo field. The Accursed Mountains and Šar Mountains rise in the southwest and southeast, respectively. Kosovo's capital and largest city is Pristina.
