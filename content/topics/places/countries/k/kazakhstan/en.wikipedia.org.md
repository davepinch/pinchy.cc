  **Kazakhstan**, officially the **Republic of Kazakhstan**, is a landlocked country mostly in [Central Asia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia/), with a part in Eastern Europe. It borders [Russia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia/) to the north and west, [China](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China/) to the east, [Kyrgyzstan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrgyzstan/) to the southeast, [Uzbekistan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbekistan/) to the south, and [Turkmenistan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkmenistan/) to the southwest, with a coastline along the [Caspian Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea/). Its capital is Astana, while the largest city and leading cultural and commercial hub is Almaty. Kazakhstan is the world's ninth-largest country by land area and the largest landlocked country. It has a population of 20 million and one of the lowest population densities in the world, at fewer than 6 people per square kilometre (16 people/sq mi). Ethnic Kazakhs constitute a majority, while ethnic Russians form a significant minority. Officially secular, Kazakhstan is a Muslim-majority country, although ethnic Russians in the country form a sizeable Christian community.
