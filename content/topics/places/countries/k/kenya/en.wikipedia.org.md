excerpt: >-
  **Kenya**, officially the **Republic of Kenya** (Swahili: *Jamhuri ya Kenya*), is a country in East Africa. With a population of more than 47.6 million in the 2019 census, Kenya is the 28th-most-populous country in the world and 7th most populous in Africa. Kenya's capital and largest city is Nairobi, while its oldest and second-largest city, is the major port city of Mombasa, situated on Mombasa Island in the [Indian Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean/) and the surrounding mainland. Mombasa was the capital of the British East Africa Protectorate, which included most of what is now Kenya and southwestern Somalia, from 1889 to 1907. Other important cities include Kisumu and Nakuru. Kenya is bordered by South Sudan to the northwest, [Ethiopia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia/) to the north, [Somalia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia/) to the east, [Uganda](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda/) to the west, [Tanzania](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzania/) to the south, and the [Indian Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean/) to the southeast. Kenya's geography, climate and population vary widely, ranging from cold snow-capped mountaintops (Batian, Nelion and Point Lenana on Mount Kenya) with vast surrounding forests, wildlife and fertile agricultural regions to temperate climates in western and rift valley counties and further on to dry less fertile arid and semi-arid areas and absolute deserts (Chalbi Desert and Nyiri Desert).
