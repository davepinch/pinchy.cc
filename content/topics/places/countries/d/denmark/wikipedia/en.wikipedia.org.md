It is the metropolitan part of and the most populous constituent of the Kingdom of Denmark, a constitutionally unitary state that includes the autonomous territories of the Faroe Islands and Greenland in the North Atlantic Ocean. Metropolitan Denmark is the southernmost of the Scandinavian countries, lying south-west and south (Bornholm and Ertholmene) of [Sweden](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden/), south of [Norway](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway/), and north of [Germany](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany/), with which it shares a short border, Denmark's only land border.
