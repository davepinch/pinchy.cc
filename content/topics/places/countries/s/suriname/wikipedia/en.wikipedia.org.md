  **Suriname** (/ˈsʊərɪnæm, -nɑːm/ SOOR-ih-NAM, -⁠NAHM, Dutch: [syːriˈnaːmə]), officially the **Republic of Suriname** (Dutch: Republiek Suriname [reːpyˌblik ˌsyːriˈnaːmə]), is a country in northern [South America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America/), sometimes considered part of the Caribbean and the West Indies. Situated slightly north of the equator, over 90% of its territory is covered by rainforests, the highest proportion of forest cover in the world. Suriname is bordered by the [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean/) to the north, [French Guiana](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Guiana/) to the east, [Guyana](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyana/) to the west, and [Brazil](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil/) to the south. It is the smallest country in South America by both population and territory, with around 612,985 inhabitants in an area of approximately 163,820 square kilometers (63,251 square miles). The capital and largest city is Paramaribo, which is home to roughly half the population.
