  **South Africa**, officially the **Republic of South Africa** (**RSA** or **R.S.A.**), is the southernmost country in [Africa](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa/). It is bounded to the south by 2,798 kilometres (1,739 mi) of coastline that stretches along the South Atlantic and [Indian](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean/) Oceans; to the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe; and to the east and northeast by Mozambique and Eswatini. It also completely enclaves Lesotho. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World, and the second-most populous country located entirely south of the equator, after Tanzania. South Africa is a biodiversity hotspot, with unique biomes, plant and animal life. With over 62 million people, the country is the world's 23rd-most populous nation and covers an area of 1,221,037 square kilometres (471,445 square miles). Pretoria is the administrative capital, while Cape Town, as the seat of Parliament, is the legislative capital. Bloemfontein has traditionally been regarded as the judicial capital. The Constitutional Court, the country's highest court, is located in Johannesburg.
