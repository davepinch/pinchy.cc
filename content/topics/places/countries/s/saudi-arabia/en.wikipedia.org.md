excerpt: >-
  **Saudi Arabia**, officially the **Kingdom of Saudi Arabia** (**KSA**), is a country in [West Asia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Asia/). It covers the bulk of the Arabian Peninsula and has a land area of about 2150000 km2 (830000 sq mi), making it the fifth-largest country in [Asia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia/) and the largest in the Middle East. It is bordered by the [Red Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea/) to the west; [Jordan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan/), [Iraq](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq/), and [Kuwait](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait/) to the north; the [Persian Gulf](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf/), [Qatar](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar/) and the [United Arab Emirates](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates/) to the east; [Oman](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman/) to the southeast; and [Yemen](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen/) to the south. [Bahrain](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain/) is an island country off its east coast. The [Gulf of Aqaba](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Aqaba/) in the northwest separates Saudi Arabia from Egypt and [Israel](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel/). Saudi Arabia is the only country with a coastline along both the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, and most of its terrain consists of arid desert, lowland, steppe, and mountains. Saudi Arabia's capital and largest city is Riyadh; the kingdom is also the location of Islam's two holiest cities of [Mecca](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca/) and Medina.
