  The **Soviet Union**, officially the **Union of Soviet Socialist Republics** (**USSR**), was a transcontinental country that spanned much of [Eurasia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia/) from 1922 to 1991. It was a successor state to the Russian Empire that was nominally organized as a federal union of fifteen national republics, the largest and most populous of which was the Russian SFSR; in practice both its government and economy were highly centralized until its final years. As a one-party state governed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, it was a flagship communist state.
