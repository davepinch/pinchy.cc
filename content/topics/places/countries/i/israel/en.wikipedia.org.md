It is bordered by [Lebanon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon/) to the north, by [Syria](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria/) to the northeast, by [Jordan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan/) to the east, by the [Red Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea/) to the south, by [Egypt](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt/) to the southwest, by the [Mediterranean Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea/) to the west, and by the [Palestinian territories](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories/) – the [West Bank](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank/) along the east and the [Gaza Strip](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip/) along the southwest.
