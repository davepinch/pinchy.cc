excerpt: >-
  **Namibia** (/nəˈmɪbiə/, /næˈ-/), officially the **Republic of Namibia**, is a country in Southern Africa. Its western border is the [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean/). It shares land borders with [Angola](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angola/) and [Zambia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambia/) to the north, [Botswana](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana/) to the east and [South Africa](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa/) to the east and south. Although it does not border [Zimbabwe](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe/), less than 200 metres (660 feet) of the Botswanan right bank of the Zambezi River separates the two countries. Its capital and largest city is Windhoek.
