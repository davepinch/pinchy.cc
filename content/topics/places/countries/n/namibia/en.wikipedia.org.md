excerpt: >-
  **Namibia** (/nəˈmɪbiə/, /næˈ-/), officially the **Republic of Namibia**, is a country in Southern Africa. Its western border is the [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean/). It shares land borders with Angola and [Zambia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambia/) to the north, [Botswana](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana/) to the east and [South Africa](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa/) to the east and south. Although it does not border Zimbabwe, less than 200 metres (660 feet) of the Botswanan right bank of the Zambezi River separates the two countries. Its capital and largest city is Windhoek.
