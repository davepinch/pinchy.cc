  **North Korea**, officially the **Democratic People's Republic of Korea** (**DPRK**), is a country in [East Asia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia/). It constitutes the northern half of the Korean Peninsula and borders [China](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China/) and [Russia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia/) to the north at the Yalu (Amnok) and Tumen rivers, and [South Korea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea/) to the south at the Korean Demilitarized Zone. The country's western border is formed by the Yellow Sea, while its eastern border is defined by the Sea of Japan. North Korea, like its southern counterpart, claims to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands. Pyongyang is the capital and largest city.
