excerpt: >-
  What I bring you today is a real gem that I have been searching for a long time and have finally managed to get my hands on a copy1. It is a collection of 672 maps found in the Great Korean Encyclopaedia2, North Korea’s reference encyclopaedia. More specifically, it is an electronic edition published on CD in the first decade of the 2000s.
