  **New Zealand** (Māori: Aotearoa [aɔˈtɛaɾɔa]) is an island country in the southwestern [Pacific Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean/). It consists of two main landmasses—the North Island (Te Ika-a-Māui) and the South Island (Te Waipounamu)—and over 700 smaller islands. It is the sixth-largest island country by area and lies east of [Australia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia/) across the Tasman Sea and south of the islands of New Caledonia, [Fiji](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji/), and Tonga. The country's varied topography and sharp mountain peaks, including the Southern Alps, owe much to tectonic uplift and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, and its most populous city is Auckland.

  Add rule to collate.ps1 that "near" references should go both ways. For example, if Australia is near Fiji, then Fiji should be near Australia.
