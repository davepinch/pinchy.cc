  **Mauritania**, officially the **Islamic Republic of Mauritania** (Arabic: الجمهورية الإسلامية الموريتانية, al-Jumhūrīyah al-Islāmīyah al-Mūrītānīyah), is a sovereign country in Northwest Africa. It is bordered by the [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean/) to the west, [Western Sahara](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara/) to the north and northwest, [Algeria](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria/) to the northeast, [Mali](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali/) to the east and southeast, and Senegal to the southwest. By land area Mauritania is the 11th-largest country in Africa and 28th-largest in the world; 90% of its territory is in the Sahara. Most of its population of some 4.3 million lives in the temperate south of the country, with roughly a third concentrated in the capital and largest city, Nouakchott, on the Atlantic coast.
