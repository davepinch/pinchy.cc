  **Qatar**, officially the **State of Qatar**, is a country in [West Asia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Asia/). It occupies the Qatar Peninsula on the northeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula in the [Middle East](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East/); it shares its sole land border with [Saudi Arabia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia/) to the south, with the rest of its territory surrounded by the [Persian Gulf](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf/). The [Gulf of Bahrain](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Bahrain/), an inlet of the Persian Gulf, separates Qatar from nearby Bahrain. The capital is Doha, home to over 80% of the country's inhabitants, and the land area is mostly made up of flat, low-lying desert.
