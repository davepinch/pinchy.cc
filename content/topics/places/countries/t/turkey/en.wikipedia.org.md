It is mainly on the Anatolian Peninsula in West Asia, with a small portion called East Thrace on the Balkan Peninsula in Southeast Europe. It borders the [Black Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea/) to the north; [Georgia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)/) to the northeast; [Armenia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia/), [Azerbaijan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan/), and [Iran](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran/) to the east; [Iraq](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq/) to the southeast; [Syria](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria/) and the [Mediterranean Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea/) to the south; the [Aegean Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegean_Sea/) to the west; and [Greece](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece/) and [Bulgaria](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria/) to the northwest. Cyprus is off the south coast. Most of the country's citizens are ethnic Turks, while Kurds are the largest ethnic minority. Ankara is Turkey's capital and second-largest city, while Istanbul is its largest city and economic and financial centre, as well as the largest city in Europe.
