It borders the [Black Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea/) to the north; [Georgia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)/) to the northeast; [Armenia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia/), [Azerbaijan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan/), and [Iran](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran/) to the east; [Iraq](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq/) to the southeast; [Syria](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria/) and the [Mediterranean Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea/) to the south; the [Aegean Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegean_Sea/) to the west; and [Greece](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece/) and [Bulgaria](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria/) to the northwest.
