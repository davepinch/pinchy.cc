excerpt: >-
  **Transnistria**, or **Pridnestrovie**, officially known as the **Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic** (**PMR**), is a breakaway state internationally recognized as part of [Moldova](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldova/). Transnistria controls most of the narrow strip of land between the Dniester river and the Moldova–Ukraine border, as well as some land on the other side of the river's bank. Its capital and largest city is Tiraspol. Transnistria is officially designated by the Republic of Moldova as the Administrative-Territorial Units of the Left Bank of the Dniester (Romanian: U*nitățile Administrativ-Teritoriale din stînga Nistrului*) or as *Stînga Nistrului* ("Left (Bank) of the Dniester").
