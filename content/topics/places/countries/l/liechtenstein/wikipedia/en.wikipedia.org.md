  **Liechtenstein** (/ˈlɪktənstaɪn/, *LIK-tən-styne*; German: [ˈlɪçtn̩ʃtaɪn]), officially the **Principality of Liechtenstein** (German: *Fürstentum Liechtenstein*, [ˈfʏʁstn̩tuːm ˈlɪçtn̩ˌʃtaɪ̯n]), is a doubly landlocked German-speaking microstate in the Central European Alps, between Austria in the east and north and Switzerland in the west and south. Liechtenstein is a semi-constitutional monarchy headed by the prince of Liechtenstein of the House of Liechtenstein, currently led by Hans-Adam II. It is Europe's fourth-smallest country, with an area of just over 160 square kilometres (62 square miles) and a population of 40,023. It is the world's smallest country to border two countries, and is one of the few countries with no debt.
