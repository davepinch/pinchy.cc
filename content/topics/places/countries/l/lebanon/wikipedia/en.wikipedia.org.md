  **Lebanon**, officially the **Republic of Lebanon**, is a country in [West Asia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Asia/). It is bordered by [Syria](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria) to the north and east, by [Israel](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel/) to the south, and by the [Mediterranean Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea/) to the west; Cyprus lies a short distance away from the country's coastline. Lebanon's location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterlands has contributed to the country's rich history and shaped a unique cultural identity denoted by religious diversity. Located in the Levant region of the Eastern Mediterranean, the country has a population of more than five million people and covers an area of 10,452 square kilometres (4,036 sq mi). Lebanon's capital and largest city is [Beirut](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut/), followed by Tripoli and Jounieh. While Arabic is the official language, French is also recognized in a formal capacity; Lebanese Arabic is the country's vernacular, though French and English play a relatively significant role in everyday life, with Modern Standard Arabic being limited to news and government matters.
