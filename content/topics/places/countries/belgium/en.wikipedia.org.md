The country is bordered by the [Netherlands](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands/) to the north, [Germany](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany/) to the east, [Luxembourg](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg/) to the southeast, [France](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France/) to the south, and the North Sea to the west. It covers an area of 30,689 km2 (11,849 sq mi) and has a population of more than 11.5 million, making it the 22nd most densely populated country in the world and the 6th most densely populated country in Europe, with a density of 376/km2 (970/sq mi).
