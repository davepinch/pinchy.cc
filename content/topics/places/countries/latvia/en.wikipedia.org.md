It is one of the three Baltic states, along with [Estonia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia/) to the north and [Lithuania](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania/) to the south. It borders [Russia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia/) to the east, Belarus to the southeast, and shares a maritime border with [Sweden](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden/) to the west. Latvia covers an area of 64,589 km2 (24,938 sq mi), with a population of 1.9 million. The country has a temperate seasonal climate. Its capital and largest city is Riga. Latvians belong to the ethnolinguistic group of the Balts and speak Latvian, one of the only two surviving Baltic languages. Russians are the most prominent minority in the country, at almost a quarter of the population.
