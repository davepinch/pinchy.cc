  **Slovenia** (/sloʊˈviːniə, slə-/ *sloh-VEE-nee-ə*; Slovene: Slovenija [slɔˈʋèːnija]), officially the **Republic of Slovenia** (Slovene: *Republika Slovenija*, abbr.: *RS*), is a country in southern Central Europe. Slovenia is bordered by [Italy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy/) to the west, [Austria](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria/) to the north, [Hungary](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary/) to the northeast, [Croatia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia/) to the south and southeast, and a short coastline within the Adriatic Sea to the southwest. Slovenia is mostly mountainous and forested, covers 20,271 square kilometres (7,827 sq mi), and has a population of 2.1 million (2,110,547 people). Slovenes constitute over 80% of the country's population. Slovene, a South Slavic language, is the official language. Slovenia has a predominantly temperate continental climate, with the exception of the Slovene Littoral and the Julian Alps. A sub-mediterranean climate reaches to the northern extensions of the Dinaric Alps that traverse the country in a northwest–southeast direction. The Julian Alps in the northwest have an alpine climate. Toward the northeastern Pannonian Basin, a continental climate is more pronounced. Ljubljana, the capital and largest city of Slovenia, is geographically situated near the centre of the country.
