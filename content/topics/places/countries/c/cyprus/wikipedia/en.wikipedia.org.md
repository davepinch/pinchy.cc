  **Cyprus** (/ˈsaɪprəs/), officially the **Republic of Cyprus**, is an island country in the eastern [Mediterranean Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea/), north of the [Sinai Peninsula](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinai_Peninsula/), south of the Anatolian Peninsula, and west of the Levant. It is geographically a part of [West Asia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Asia/), but its cultural ties and geopolitics are overwhelmingly Southeast European. Cyprus is the third largest and third-most populous island in the Mediterranean. It is east of [Greece](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece/), north of [Egypt](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt/), south of [Turkey](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey/), and west of [Lebanon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon/) and [Syria](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria/). Its capital and largest city is Nicosia. The northeast portion of the island is de facto governed by the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.
