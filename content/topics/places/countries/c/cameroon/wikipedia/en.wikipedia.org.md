  **Cameroon**, officially the **Republic of Cameroon**, is a country in Central Africa. It shares boundaries with [Nigeria](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria/) to the west and north, [Chad](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad/) to the northeast, the [Central African Republic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_African_Republic/) to the east, and [Equatorial Guinea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_Guinea/), [Gabon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabon/) and the [Republic of the Congo](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_the_Congo/) to the south. Its coastline lies on the Bight of Biafra, part of the [Gulf of Guinea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Guinea/) and the [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean/). Due to its strategic position at the crossroads between West Africa and Central Africa, it has been categorized as being in both camps. Its nearly 27 million people speak 250 native languages, in addition to the national tongues of English and French, or both.
