  **Colombia**, officially the **Republic of Colombia**, is a country primarily located in South America with insular regions in [North America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America/). The Colombian mainland is bordered by the [Caribbean Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Sea/) to the north, [Venezuela](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela/) to the east and northeast, [Brazil](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil/) to the southeast, [Ecuador](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador/) and [Peru](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru/) to the south and southwest, the [Pacific Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean/) to the west, and [Panama](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama/) to the northwest. Colombia is divided into 32 departments. The Capital District of Bogotá is also the country's largest city hosting the main financial and cultural hub. Other major urbes include Medellín, Cali, Barranquilla, Cartagena, Santa Marta, Cúcuta, Ibagué, Villavicencio and Bucaramanga. It covers an area of 1,141,748 square kilometers (440,831 sq mi) and has a population of around 52 million. Its rich cultural heritage—including language, religion, cuisine, and art—reflects its history as a colony, fusing cultural elements brought by immigration from Europe and the Middle East, with those brought by the African diaspora, as well as with those of the various Indigenous civilizations that predate colonization. Spanish is the official language, although Creole, English and 64 other languages are recognized regionally.
