  **Andorra**, officially the **Principality of Andorra**, is a sovereign landlocked country on the [Iberian Peninsula](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula/), in the eastern Pyrenees, bordered by [France](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France/) to the north and [Spain](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain/) to the south. Believed to have been created by Charlemagne, Andorra was ruled by the count of Urgell until 988, when it was transferred to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell. The present principality was formed by a charter in 1278. It is currently headed by two co-princes: the bishop of Urgell in Catalonia, Spain and the president of France. Its capital and largest city is Andorra la Vella.
