  **Albania** (/ælˈbeɪniə, ɔːl-/ *a(w)l-BAY-nee-ə*; Albanian: *Shqipëri* or *Shqipëria*), officially the **Republic of Albania** (Albanian: *Republika e Shqipërisë*), is a country in [Southeast Europe](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Europe/). The country is located in the Balkans on the [Adriatic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriatic_Sea/) and [Ionian](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_Sea/) Seas within the [Mediterranean Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea/) and shares land borders with [Montenegro](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro/) to the northwest, [Kosovo](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo/) to the northeast, [North Macedonia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Macedonia/) to the east and [Greece](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece/) to the south. Spanning an area of 28,748 km2 (11,100 sq mi), it displays a varied range of climatic, geological, hydrological and morphological conditions. The country's landscapes range from rugged snow-capped mountains in the Albanian Alps and the Korab, Skanderbeg, Pindus and Ceraunian Mountains, to fertile lowland plains extending from the coasts of the Adriatic and Ionian seas. Tirana is the capital and largest city in the country, followed by Durrës, Vlorë, and Shkodër.
