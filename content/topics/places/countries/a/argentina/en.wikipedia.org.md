excerpt: >-
  **Argentina**, officially the **Argentine Republic**, is a country in the southern half of [South America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America/). Argentina covers an area of 2,780,400 km^2 (1,073,500 sq mi), making it the second-largest country in South America after [Brazil](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil/), the fourth-largest country in the Americas, and the eighth-largest country in the world. It shares the bulk of the Southern Cone with [Chile](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile/) to the west, and is also bordered by [Bolivia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia/) and [Paraguay](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay/) to the north, [Brazil](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil/) to the northeast, [Uruguay](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay/) and the South [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean/) to the east, and the [Drake Passage](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Passage/) to the south. Argentina is a federal state subdivided into twenty-three provinces, and one autonomous city, which is the federal capital and largest city of the nation, Buenos Aires. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. Argentina claims sovereignty over the [Falkland Islands](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islands/), South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, and a part of Antarctica.
