  **North Macedonia** (/ˌmæsɪˈdoʊniə/ *MASS-ih-DOH-nee-ə*), officially the **Republic of North Macedonia**, is a landlocked country in Southeast Europe. It shares land borders with [Greece](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece/) to the south, [Albania](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania/) to the west, [Bulgaria](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria/) to the east, [Kosovo](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo/) to the northwest and [Serbia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia/) to the north. It constitutes approximately the northern third of the larger geographical region of Macedonia. Skopje, the capital and largest city, is home to a quarter of the country's 1.83 million people. The majority of the residents are ethnic Macedonians, a South Slavic people. Albanians form a significant minority at around 25%, followed by Turks, Roma, Serbs, Bosniaks, Aromanians and a few other minorities.
