  **Egypt** (Arabic: مصر Miṣr [mesˁr], Egyptian Arabic pronunciation: [mɑsˤr]), officially the **Arab Republic of Egypt**, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of [Africa](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa/) and the [Sinai Peninsula](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinai_Peninsula/) in the southwest corner of Asia. It is bordered by the [Mediterranean Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea/) to the north, the [Gaza Strip](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip/) of [Palestine](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories/) and [Israel](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel/) to the northeast, the [Red Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea/) to the east, [Sudan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan/) to the south, and [Libya](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya/) to the west. The [Gulf of Aqaba](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Aqaba/) in the northeast separates Egypt from [Jordan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan/) and [Saudi Arabia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia/). Cairo is the capital and largest city of Egypt, while Alexandria, the second-largest city, is an important industrial and tourist hub at the Mediterranean coast. At approximately 100 million inhabitants, Egypt is the 14th-most populated country in the world, and the third-most populated in Africa, behind Nigeria and Ethiopia.
