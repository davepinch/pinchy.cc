excerpt: >-
  **Vatican City** (/ˈvætɪkən/), officially the **Vatican City State** (Italian: *Stato della Città del Vaticano*; Latin: *Status Civitatis Vaticanae*), is a landlocked independent country, city-state, microstate, and enclave within [Rome](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome/), [Italy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy/). It became independent from Italy in 1929 with the Lateran Treaty, and it is a distinct territory under "full ownership, exclusive dominion, and sovereign authority and jurisdiction" of the Holy See, itself a sovereign entity under international law, which maintains the city-state's temporal power and governance, diplomatic, and spiritual independence.
