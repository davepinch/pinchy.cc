  **Guyana** (/ɡaɪˈɑːnə/ or /ɡaɪˈænə/ ghy-A(H)N-ə), officially the **Co-operative Republic of Guyana**, is a country on the northern coast of [South America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America/), part of the historic mainland British West Indies. Guyana is an indigenous word which means "Land of Many Waters". Georgetown is the capital of Guyana and is also the country's largest city. Guyana is bordered by the [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean/) to the north, [Brazil](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil/) to the south and southwest, [Venezuela](Venezuela (Wikipedia)) to the west, and [Suriname](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suriname/) to the east. With a land area of 214,969 km2 (83,000 sq mi), Guyana is the third-smallest sovereign state by area in mainland South America after Uruguay and Suriname, and is the second-least populous sovereign state in South America after Suriname; it is also one of the least densely populated countries on Earth. It has a wide variety of natural habitats and very high biodiversity. The country also hosts a part of the Amazon rainforest, the largest tropical rainforest in the world.
