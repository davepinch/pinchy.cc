  **Luxembourg** (/ˈlʌksəmbɜːrɡ/ *LUK-səm-burg*; Luxembourgish: *Lëtzebuerg* [ˈlətsəbuəɕ]; French: Luxembourg [lyksɑ̃buʁ]; German: *Luxemburg* [ˈlʊksm̩bʊʁk], officially the **Grand Duchy of Luxembourg**, is a small landlocked country in Western Europe. It is bordered by [Belgium](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium/) to the west and north, [Germany](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany/) to the east, and [France](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France/) to the south. Its capital and most populous city, Luxembourg, is one of the four institutional seats of the European Union (together with Brussels, Frankfurt, and Strasbourg) and the seat of several EU institutions, notably the Court of Justice of the European Union, the highest judicial authority. Luxembourg's culture, people, and languages are highly intertwined with its French and German neighbors; while Luxembourgish is the only national language of the Luxembourgish people and of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, French is the only language for legislation, and all three – Luxembourgish, French and German – are used for administrative matters in the country.
