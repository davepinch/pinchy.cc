  **Algeria**, officially the **People's Democratic Republic of Algeria**, is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa. It is bordered to the northeast by [Tunisia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia/); to the east by [Libya](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya/); to the southeast by Niger; to the southwest by Mali, Mauritania, and Western Sahara; to the west by [Morocco](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco/); and to the north by the [Mediterranean Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea/). Algeria has a semi-arid climate, with the Sahara desert dominating most of the territory except for its fertile and mountainous north, where most of the population is concentrated. Spanning 2,381,741 square kilometres (919,595 sq mi), it is the world's tenth largest nation by area, and the largest nation in [Africa](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa/). With a population of 44 million, Algeria is the tenth-most populous country in Africa, and the 32nd-most populous country in the world. The capital and largest city is Algiers, located in the far north on the Mediterranean coast.
