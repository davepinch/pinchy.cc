It is mainly on the Anatolian Peninsula in West Asia, with a small portion called East Thrace on the Balkan Peninsula in Southeast Europe. It borders the Black Sea to the north; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, Azerbaijan, and [Iran](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran/) to the east; [Iraq](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq/) to the southeast; [Syria](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria/) and the [Mediterranean Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea/) to the south; the Aegean Sea to the west; and Greece and Bulgaria to the northwest. Cyprus is off the south coast. Most of the country's citizens are ethnic Turks, while Kurds are the largest ethnic minority. Ankara is Turkey's capital and second-largest city, while Istanbul is its largest city and economic and financial centre, as well as the largest city in Europe.
