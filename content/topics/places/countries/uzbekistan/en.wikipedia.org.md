  **Uzbekistan**, officially the **Republic of Uzbekistan**, is a doubly landlocked country located in Central Asia. It is surrounded by five countries: [Kazakhstan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan/) to the north, [Kyrgyzstan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrgyzstan/) to the northeast, [Tajikistan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajikistan/) to the southeast, [Afghanistan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan/) to the south, and [Turkmenistan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkmenistan/) to the southwest, making it one of only two doubly landlocked countries on Earth, the other being [Liechtenstein](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liechtenstein/). Uzbekistan is part of the Turkic world, as well as a member of the Organization of Turkic States. Uzbek is the majority language, while Russian is widely spoken and understood. Islam is the predominant religion, and most Uzbeks are Sunni Muslims.
