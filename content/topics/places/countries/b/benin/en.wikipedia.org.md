  **Benin** (/bɛˈniːn/ *ben-EEN*, /bɪˈniːn/ *bin-EEN*; French: Bénin [benɛ̃], Fon: Benɛ, Fula: Benen), officially the **Republic of Benin** (French: *République du Bénin*), and also known as **Dahomey**, is a country in West Africa. It is bordered by [Togo](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Togo/) to the west, [Nigeria](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria/) to the east, [Burkina Faso](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkina_Faso/) to the North-west, and [Niger](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger/) to the North-east. The majority of its population lives on the southern coastline of the Bight of Benin, part of the [Gulf of Guinea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Guinea/) in the northernmost tropical portion of the Atlantic Ocean. The capital is Porto-Novo, and the seat of government is in Cotonou, the most populous city and economic capital. Benin covers an area of 114,763 km2 (44,310 sq mi), and its population in 2021 was estimated to be approximately 13 million. It is a small, tropical country. It is one of the least developed, with an economy heavily dependent on agriculture, and is an exporter of palm oil and cotton. Some employment and income arise from subsistence agriculture.
