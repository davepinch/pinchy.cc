excerpt: >-
  **Botswana**, officially the **Republic of Botswana**, is a landlocked country in Southern Africa. Botswana is topographically flat, with approximately 70 percent of its territory being the Kalahari Desert. It is bordered by [South Africa](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa/) to the south and southeast, [Namibia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia/) to the west and north, [Zambia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambia/) to the north and [Zimbabwe](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe/) to the northeast. Being a country of slightly over 2.4 million people, and roughly the size of France, Botswana is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world. It is essentially the nation state of the Tswana people, who make up 79% of the population.
