  **Bosnia and Herzegovina** (Serbo-Croatian: *Bosna i Hercegovina*, Босна и Херцеговина), sometimes known as **Bosnia-Herzegovina** and informally as **Bosnia**, is a country in [Southeast Europe](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Europe/), situated on the Balkan Peninsula. It borders [Serbia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia/) to the east, [Montenegro](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro/) to the southeast, and [Croatia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia/) to the north and southwest. In the south it has a 20 kilometres (12 miles) long coast on the [Adriatic Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriatic_Sea/), with the town of Neum being its only access to the sea. Bosnia has a moderate continental climate with hot summers and cold, snowy winters. In the central and eastern regions, the geography is mountainous, in the northwest it is moderately hilly, and in the northeast it is predominantly flat. Herzegovina, the smaller, southern region, has a Mediterranean climate and is mostly mountainous. Sarajevo is the capital and the largest city.
