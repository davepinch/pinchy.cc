  **Oman**, officially the **Sultanate of Oman**, is a country in [West Asia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Asia/). It is located on the southeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula, and overlooks the mouth of the [Persian Gulf](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf/). It shares land borders with [Saudi Arabia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia/), the [United Arab Emirates](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates/), and [Yemen](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen/), while sharing maritime borders with [Iran](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran/) and [Pakistan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan/). The capital and largest city is Muscat. Oman has a population of nearly 4.7 million and is the 124th most-populous country. The coast faces the [Arabian Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Sea/) on the southeast, and the Gulf of Oman on the northeast. The Madha and Musandam exclaves are surrounded by United Arab Emirates on their land borders, with the Strait of Hormuz (which it shares with Iran) and the Gulf of Oman forming Musandam's coastal boundaries.
