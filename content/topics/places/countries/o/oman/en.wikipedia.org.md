  **Oman**, officially the **Sultanate of Oman**, is a country in [West Asia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Asia/). It is located on the southeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula, and overlooks the mouth of the [Persian Gulf](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf/). It shares land borders with [Saudi Arabia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia/), the [United Arab Emirates](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates/), and [Yemen](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen/), while sharing maritime borders with [Iran](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran/) and [Pakistan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan/). The capital and largest city is Muscat. Oman has a population of nearly 4.7 million and is the 124th most-populous country. The coast faces the Arabian Sea on the southeast, and the Gulf of Oman on the northeast.
