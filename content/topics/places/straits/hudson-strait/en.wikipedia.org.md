  **Hudson Strait** (French: Détroit d'Hudson) in Nunavut links the [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean/) and the [Labrador Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrador_Sea/) to [Hudson Bay](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Bay/) in [Canada](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada/). This strait lies between Baffin Island and Nunavik, with its eastern entrance marked by Cape Chidley in Newfoundland and Labrador and Nunavut and Resolution Island, off Baffin Island. The strait is about 750 km (470 mi) long with an average width of 125 km (78 mi), varying from 70 km (43 mi) at the eastern entrance to 240 km (150 mi) at Deception Bay.
