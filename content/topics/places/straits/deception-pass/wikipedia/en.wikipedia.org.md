  **Deception Pass** (Lushootseed: sčudᶻ) (Samish: Xwchsónges) is a strait separating [Whidbey Island](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whidbey_Island/) from [Fidalgo Island](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidalgo_Island/), in the northwest part of the U.S. state of [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/). It connects Skagit Bay, part of [Puget Sound](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound/), with the [Strait of Juan de Fuca](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Juan_de_Fuca/). A pair of bridges known collectively as [Deception Pass Bridge](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception_Pass_Bridge/) cross Deception Pass. The bridges were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.
