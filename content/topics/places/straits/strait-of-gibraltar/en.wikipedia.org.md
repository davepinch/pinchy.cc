excerpt: >-
  The **Strait of Gibraltar** is a narrow strait that connects the [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean/) to the [Mediterranean Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea/) and separates [Europe](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe/) from [Africa](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa/). The two continents are separated by 13 kilometres (8.1 miles; 7.0 nautical miles) of ocean at the Strait's narrowest point between Punta de Tarifa in [Spain](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain/) and Point Cires in [Morocco](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco/). Ferries cross between the two continents every day in as little as 35 minutes. The Strait's depth ranges between 300 and 900 metres (980 and 2,950 feet; 160 and 490 fathoms).
