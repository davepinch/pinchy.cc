excerpt: >-
  The rugged, barren mountains of the Musandam Peninsula juts into the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow throughway between Iran (north) and Oman and the United Arab Emirates (south) where the waters from the Gulf of Oman enter the Persian Gulf. Khasab, Oman, the main city sitting on the tip of the Musandam Peninsula, sits only 65 km (40 mi) from the Iranian city of Bandar Abbas. The rocky limestone mountains of the peninsula rise as high as 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) above sea level and create fjord-like inlets along the coast. Musandam is an exclave of Oman, separated from the rest of the country by the United Arab Emirates. Fishing, agriculture and ship building are the primary industries in this part of Oman. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board NASAâ€™s Terra satellite acquired a stunning true-color image of the Strait of Hormuz and the Musandam Peninsula on December 6, 2018.
