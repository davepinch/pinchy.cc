  The **Strait of Hormuz** (/hɔːrˈmuːz/ Persian: تنگهٔ هُرمُز *Tangeh-ye Hormoz* listen, Arabic: مَضيق هُرمُز *Maḍīq Hurmuz*) is a strait between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. It provides the only sea passage from the Persian Gulf to the open ocean and is one of the world's most strategically important choke points. On the north coast lies Iran, and on the south coast lies the Musandam peninsula, shared by the United Arab Emirates and the Musandam Governorate, an exclave of Oman. The strait is about 90 nautical miles (167 km) long, with a width varying from about 52 nmi (96 km) to 21 nmi (39 km).
