  The **Strait of Hormuz** (/hɔːrˈmuːz/ Persian: تنگهٔ هُرمُز *Tangeh-ye Hormoz*, Arabic: مَضيق هُرمُز Maḍīq Hurmuz) is a strait between the [Persian Gulf](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf/) and the [Gulf of Oman](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Oman/). It provides the only sea passage from the Persian Gulf to the open ocean and is one of the world's most strategically important choke points. On the north coast lies [Iran](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran/), and on the south coast lies the Musandam peninsula, shared by the [United Arab Emirates](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates/) and the Musandam Governorate, an exclave of [Oman](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman/). The strait is about 90 nautical miles (167 km) long, with a width varying from about 52 nmi (96 km) to 21 nmi (39 km).
