  The **Bering Strait** (Russian: Берингов пролив, romanized: *Beringov proliv*) is a [strait](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait/) between the [Pacific](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean/) and [Arctic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Ocean/) oceans, separating the Chukchi Peninsula of the Russian Far East from the Seward Peninsula of Alaska. The present Russia-United States maritime boundary is at 168° 58' 37" W longitude, slightly south of the Arctic Circle at about 65° 40' N latitude. The Strait is named after Vitus Bering, a Danish explorer in the service of the Russian Empire.
