  **North Creek School** is a school building located in [Bothell](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bothell,_Washington), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)) listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Built in 1902, it served as a school for 18 years. The first teacher was Edgar Turner, who homesteaded at the present Turner's Corner (Highway 9 and Maltby Road intersection). Another of the school's teachers was Charles V. Beardslee, who came to the Bothell area in the late 1880s. After closing in 1920, it served as a meeting location for the Canyon Park Community Club until about 1950. It was then used for storage for many years, deteriorating from lack of use and nonattendance.
