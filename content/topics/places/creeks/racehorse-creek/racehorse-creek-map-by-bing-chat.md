Bing Chat produced the text map below on January 31, 2024 while I was researching the Racehorse Creek subbasin. The prompt was "Where are Slide Mountain and racehorse Creek?".

> Slide Mountain and Racehorse Creek are both located in the state of Washington, near the border with Canada. Slide Mountain is a peak north and east of Racehorse Creek, on the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) land northwest of Mount Baker[1](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2023-11-17.4477678269). Racehorse Creek is a small waterway that flows from Slide Mountain to the Nooksack River. It is known for its fossil beds and its waterfall, Racehorse Falls[2](https://wa100.dnr.wa.gov/north-cascades/racehorse-creek). Here is a map of the area:
