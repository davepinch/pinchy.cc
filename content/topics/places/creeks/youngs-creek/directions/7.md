title: "Access Youngs Creek Falls at the second bridge on Cedar Point Road."
details:
  - There is parking on both sides the bridge.
  - Do not block the blue gate near the bridge (or any blue gate anywhere).
  - To access upstream of the waterfall, take the path next to the bridge.
  - To access downstream, go to the grassy parking spot uphill from the bridge (where you came from) and find the trail that goes downhill.
  - Otherwise keep driving to the next bridge for another access point at a different part of the creek.
