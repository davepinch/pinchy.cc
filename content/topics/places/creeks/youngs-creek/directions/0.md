title: "Directions to Youngs Creek"
before you start:
  - Purchase your Discover Pass before leaving. It is not possible to purchase a physical pass at the creek as no attendant is on duty (you may be able to purchase a temporary pass online but Internet access may be spotty).
  - Bring offline copies of maps and other information. Internet access may be spotty. This location is relatively close to civilization but Internet performance may be very slow.
  - Maintain your car. The roads are in decent shape for wilderness logging roads, but there are some potholes. Most cars will do fine except cars with very low clearance.
begin: "Start on Ben Howard Rd"

summary:
  - Young's Creek can be access in several locations in the Marckworth State Forest.
