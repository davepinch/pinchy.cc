3. Drive for approximately 1.1 miles and then stay right. At 1.1 miles you will reach a right-hand turn. Ignore the sign that implies the road is private. Turn right and keep going. Here is a [Google Maps link](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TJfbB17NfuZ67s736) of the intersection.

When parking, never block the blue gates. There are sufficient parking locations in the vicinity of both bridges.
