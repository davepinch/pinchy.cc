title: "The book, “Gem Trails Of Washington” by G. Romaine, gives directions to access Deer Creek. Romaine states that the old railroad bridge over the creek is closed to foot traffic. That is no longer true, as the bridge and railroad grade have been converted into a greenways trail. The easiest access to the creek is to cross the bridge, turn right and go down under the bridge onto the gravel bar.  Park on the shoulder of Lake Cavanaugh Road where it makes a sharp left turn just before the RR bridge."
