  **Salmon Bay** (Lushootseed: šilšul) is a portion of the [Lake Washington Ship Canal](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Washington_Ship_Canal/), which passes through the city of [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle/), linking [Lake Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Washington/) to [Puget Sound](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound/), lying west of the Fremont Cut. It is the westernmost section of the canal and empties into Puget Sound's [Shilshole Bay](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilshole_Bay/). Because of the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks, the smaller, western half of the bay is salt water, and the eastern half is fresh water (though not without saline contamination: see Lake Union).
