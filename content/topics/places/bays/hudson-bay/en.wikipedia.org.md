  **Hudson Bay**, sometimes called **Hudson's Bay** (usually historically), is a large body of saltwater in northeastern Canada with a surface area of 1,230,000 km2 (470,000 sq mi). It is located north of [Ontario](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario/), west of [Quebec](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec/), northeast of [Manitoba](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba/), and southeast of [Nunavut](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunavut/), but politically entirely part of Nunavut. It is an inland marginal sea of the Arctic Ocean. The Hudson Strait provides a connection between the Labrador Sea and the Atlantic Ocean in the northeast, while the Foxe Channel connects the Hudson Bay with the Arctic Ocean in the north. It drains a very large area, about 3,861,400 km2 (1,490,900 sq mi), that includes parts of southeastern Nunavut, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, all of Manitoba, and parts of the U.S. states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Montana. Hudson Bay's southern arm is called James Bay.
