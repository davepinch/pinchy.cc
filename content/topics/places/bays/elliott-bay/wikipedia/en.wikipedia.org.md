excerpt: >-
  **Elliott Bay** is a part of the Central Basin region of [Puget Sound](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound/). It is in the U.S. state of [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/), extending southeastward between West Point in the north and Alki Point in the south. [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle/) was founded on this body of water in the 1850s and has since grown to encompass it completely. The waterway it provides to the [Pacific Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean/) has served as a key element of the city's economy, enabling the Port of Seattle to become one of the busiest ports in the United States.
