  **Shilshole Bay** is the part of Puget Sound east of a line drawn northeasterly from Seattle's West Point in the southwest to its [Golden Gardens Park](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gardens_Park/) in the northeast. On its shores lie [Discovery Park](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_Park_(Seattle)/), the Lawton Wood section of the Magnolia neighborhood, the neighborhood of [Ballard](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballard,_Seattle/), and [Golden Gardens Park](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gardens_Park/). It is home to the Shilshole Bay Marina on Ballard's Seaview Avenue N.W. and communicates with the [Lake Washington Ship Canal](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Washington_Ship_Canal/) via the Ballard Locks.
