  **Ungava Bay** (French: baie d'Ungava, pronounced [bɛ d‿œ̃ɡava]; Inuktitut: ᐅᖓᕙ ᑲᖏᖅᓗᒃ/ungava kangiqluk) is a bay in northeastern [Canada](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada/) separating Nunavik (far northern Quebec) from Baffin Island. Although not geographically apparent, it is considered to be a marginal sea of the [Arctic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Ocean/) for climatic reasons. The bay is roughly oval-shaped, about 260 kilometres (160 mi) at its widest point and about 320 kilometres (200 mi) in length; it has an area of approximately 50,000 km2 (19,000 sq mi). It is generally fairly shallow, under 150 metres (490 ft), though at its border with the [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean/) depths of almost 300 metres (980 ft) are reached.
