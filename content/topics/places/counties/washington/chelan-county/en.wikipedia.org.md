The county seat and largest city is [Wenatchee](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenatchee,_Washington/). The county was created out of [Okanogan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okanogan_County,_Washington/) and [Kittitas](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kittitas_County,_Washington/) Counties on March 13, 1899. It derives its name from a Chelan Indian word meaning "deep water," likely a reference to 55-mile (89 km)-long Lake Chelan, which reaches a maximum depth of 1,486 feet (453 m).
