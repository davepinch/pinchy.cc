excerpt: >-
  **Interstate 94** (**I-94**) is an east–west Interstate Highway connecting the Great Lakes and northern Great Plains regions of the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States/). Its western terminus is just east of Billings, [Montana](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana/), at a junction with I-90; its eastern terminus is in Port Huron, [Michigan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan/), where it meets with I-69 and crosses the Blue Water Bridge into Sarnia, [Ontario](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario/), [Canada](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada/), where the route becomes Ontario Highway 402. It thus lies along the primary overland route from Seattle (via I-90) to Toronto (via Ontario Highway 401) and is the only east–west Interstate Highway to have a direct connection to Canada.
