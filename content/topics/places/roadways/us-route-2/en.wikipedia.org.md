  **U.S. Route 2** or **U.S. Highway 2** (**US 2**) is an eastâ€“west United States Numbered Highway spanning 2,571 miles (4,138 km) across the northern continental [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States/). US 2 consists of two segments connected by various roadways in southern [Canada](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada/). Unlike some routes, which are disconnected into segments because of encroaching Interstate Highways, the two portions of US 2 were designed to be separate in the original 1926 highway plan.
