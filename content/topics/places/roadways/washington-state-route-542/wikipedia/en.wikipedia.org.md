  **State Route 542** (**SR 542**) is a 57.24-mile-long (92.12 km) state highway in the U.S. state of [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/), serving [Mount Baker](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Baker/) in [Whatcom County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whatcom_County,_Washington). SR 542 travels east as the Mount Baker Highway from an interchange with [Interstate 5](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_5_in_Washington/) (I-5) in [Bellingham](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellingham,_Washington/) through the [Nooksack River](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nooksack_River/) valley to the Mt. Baker Ski Area at Austin Pass. It serves as the main highway to Mount Baker and the communities of [Deming](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deming,_Washington/), [Kendall](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall,_Washington/), and [Maple Falls](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_Falls,_Washington/) along the Nooksack River. The highway was constructed in 1893 by Whatcom County as a wagon road between Bellingham and Maple Falls and was added to the state highway system as a branch of State Road 1 in 1925. The branch was transferred to Primary State Highway 1 (PSH 1) during its creation in 1937 and became SR 542 during the 1964 highway renumbering.
