  **State Route 9** (**SR 9**) is a 98.17-mile (157.99 km) long state highway traversing three counties, [Snohomish](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snohomish_County,_Washington/), [Skagit](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skagit_County,_Washington/), and [Whatcom](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whatcom_County,_Washington/), in the U.S. state of [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/). The highway extends north from an interchange with [SR 522](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_State_Route_522/) in the vicinity of [Woodinville](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodinville,_Washington/) north through [Snohomish](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snohomish,_Washington/), Lake Stevens, [Arlington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Washington/), [Sedro-Woolley](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedro-Woolley,_Washington/), and Nooksack to become British Columbia Highway 11 (BC 11) at the Canadaâ€“US border in Sumas. Three other roadways are briefly concurrent with the route: SR 530 in Arlington, SR 20 in Sedro-Woolley, and SR 542 near [Deming](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deming,_Washington/). A spur route in Sumas serves trucks traveling into [British Columbia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia/).
