  **State Route 20** (**SR 20**), also known as the **North Cascades Highway**, is a state highway that traverses the U.S. state of [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/). It is the state's longest highway, traveling 436 miles (702 km) across the northern areas of Washington, from U.S. Route 101 (US 101) at Discovery Bay on the [Olympic Peninsula](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Peninsula/) to US 2 near the [Idaho](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho/) state border in Newport. The highway travels across Whidbey Island, North Cascades National Park, the Okanagan Highland, the Kettle River Range, and the Selkirk Mountains.
