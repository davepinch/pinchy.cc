Approximately 25 miles (40 km) long, it connects the city of Seattle to the northeastern suburbs of [Kenmore](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenmore,_Washington/), [Bothell](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bothell,_Washington/), [Woodinville](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodinville,_Washington/), and [Monroe](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe,_Washington/). Its western half is primarily an arterial street, named Lake City Way and Bothell Way, that follows the northern shore of [Lake Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Washington/); the eastern half is a grade-separated freeway that runs between Woodinville and Monroe.
