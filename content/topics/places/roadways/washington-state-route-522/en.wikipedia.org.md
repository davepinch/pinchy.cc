  **State Route 522** (**SR 522**) is a state highway in the U.S. state of [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/) that serves the [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle/) metropolitan area. Approximately 25 miles (40 km) long, it connects the city of Seattle to the northeastern suburbs of [Kenmore](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenmore,_Washington/), [Bothell](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bothell,_Washington/), [Woodinville](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodinville,_Washington/), and [Monroe](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe,_Washington/). Its western half is primarily an arterial street, named Lake City Way and Bothell Way, that follows the northern shore of [Lake Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Washington/); the eastern half is a grade-separated freeway that runs between Woodinville and Monroe. SR 522 connects several of the metropolitan area's major highways, including [Interstate 5](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_5_in_Washington/) (I-5), I-405, SR 9, and U.S. Route 2 (US 2).
