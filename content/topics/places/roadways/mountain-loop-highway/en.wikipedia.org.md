excerpt: >-
  The **Mountain Loop Highway** is a scenic byway in the U.S. state of Washington. It traverses the western section of the [Cascade Range](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Range/) within [Snohomish County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snohomish_County,_Washington/). The name suggests it forms a full loop, but it only is a small portion of a loop, which is completed using State Routes 92, 9, and 530. Part of the highway is also a designated and signed Forest Highway, and is known as Forest Route 20.
