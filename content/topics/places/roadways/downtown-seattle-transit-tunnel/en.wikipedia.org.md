The double-track tunnel and its four stations serve Link light rail trains on the 1 Line as it travels through Downtown Seattle. It runs west under [Pine Street](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Street/) from 9th Avenue to 3rd Avenue, and south under 3rd Avenue to South Jackson Street. 1 Line trains continue north from the tunnel to Northgate station and south through the Rainier Valley past [Seattle–Tacoma International Airport](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle–Tacoma_International_Airport/) to Angle Lake station as part of Sound Transit's light rail network.
