excerpt: >-
  Tinkham Road is a national forest boondocking area 1 hour east of Seattle, WA that goes through a very lush, densely forested area. There is practically no solar charging here. Young branches reach in on the roads, we couldn't even drive the access road without hanging branches brushing our roof.
