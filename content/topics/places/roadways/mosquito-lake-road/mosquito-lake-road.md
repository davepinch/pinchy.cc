description: >-
  On Mosquito Lake Road, you can visit all three forks of the Nooksack River. In the north, Mosquito Lake Road exists Washington State Route 9 in Welcome, Washington. There it crosses the North Fork Nooksack River. Incidenally, the North Fork Road immediately after Welome is the primary access point for Racehorse Creek and the fossil fields. Mosquito Lake Road continues until it crosses the Middle Fork Nooksack River about half way to Acme, Washington. In Acme, the road runs alongside the South Fork NookSack River for a short distance before reaching Washington State Route 9 again.
