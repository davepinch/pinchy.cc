  **Ediz Hook** is a 3-mile-long (4.8 km) sand spit that extends from northern shore of the [Olympic Peninsula](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Peninsula/) at [Port Angeles](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Angeles,_Washington/) in northcentral [Clallam County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clallam_County,_Washington/), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/), USA, northeasterly into the [Strait of Juan de Fuca](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Juan_de_Fuca/), located about 15-mile (24 km) west of the larger Dungeness Spit. It is relatively narrow at points, but broader toward the base and the northeast tip.

  Much of the spit is accessible by car on the Ediz Hook Road (1.5 to 2 miles), which passes several turnouts and picnic areas, with broad views of Port Angeles and the Olympic Mountains, notably the peaks of Mount Angeles and Klahhane Ridge.
