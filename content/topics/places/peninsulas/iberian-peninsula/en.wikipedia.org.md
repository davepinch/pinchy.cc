excerpt: >-
  The **Iberian Peninsula** (IPA: /aɪˈbɪəriən/), also known as **Iberia**, is a peninsula in South-western [Europe](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe/), defining the westernmost edge of [Eurasia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia/). Separated from the rest of the European landmass by the Pyrenees, it includes the territories of Peninsular Spain and Continental Portugal, comprising most of the region, as well as the tiny adjuncts of [Andorra](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andorra/), the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar, and, pursuant to the traditional definition of the Pyrenees as the peninsula's northeastern boundary, a small part of France. With an area of approximately 583,254 square kilometres (225,196 sq mi), and a population of roughly 53 million, it is the second-largest European peninsula by area, after the Scandinavian Peninsula.
