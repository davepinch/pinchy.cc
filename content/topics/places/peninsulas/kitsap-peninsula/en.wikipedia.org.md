  The **Kitsap Peninsula** (/ˈkɪtˌsæp/) lies west of [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle) across [Puget Sound](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound/), in [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/) state in the [Pacific Northwest](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest/). [Hood Canal](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hood_Canal/) separates the peninsula from the [Olympic Peninsula](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Peninsula/) on its west side. The peninsula, a.k.a. "Kitsap", encompasses all of [Kitsap County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsap_County,_Washington/) except [Bainbridge](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bainbridge_Island,_Washington/) and Blake Islands, as well as the northeastern part of [Mason County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason_County,_Washington/) and the northwestern part of [Pierce County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierce_County,_Washington/). The highest point on the Kitsap Peninsula is Gold Mountain. The U.S. Navy's Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, and Naval Base Kitsap (comprising the former NSB Bangor and NS Bremerton) are on the peninsula. Its main city is [Bremerton](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremerton,_Washington/).
