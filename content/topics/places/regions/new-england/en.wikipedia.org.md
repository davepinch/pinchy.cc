**New England** is a region comprising six states in the Northeastern [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States): [Connecticut](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut), [Maine](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine), [Massachusetts](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts), [New Hampshire](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire), [Rhode Island](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island), and [Vermont](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont). It is bordered by the state of New York to the west and by the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick to the northeast and Quebec to the north. The Atlantic Ocean is to the east and southeast, and Long Island Sound is to the southwest. Boston is New England's largest city, as well as the capital of Massachusetts. Greater Boston is the largest metropolitan area, with nearly a third of New England's population; this area includes Worcester, Massachusetts (the second-largest city in New England), Manchester, New Hampshire (the largest city in New Hampshire), and Providence, Rhode Island (the capital of and largest city in Rhode Island).
