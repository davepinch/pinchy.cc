  **West Asia**, also called **Western Asia** or **Southwest Asia**, is the westernmost region of [Asia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia/). As defined by most academics, UN bodies and other institutions, the subregion consists of Anatolia, the Arabian Peninsula, [Iran](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran/), Mesopotamia, the Armenian highlands, the Levant, the island of Cyprus, the Sinai Peninsula, and the southern part of the Caucasus Region (Transcaucasia). The region is separated from [Africa](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa/) by the Isthmus of Suez in Egypt, and separated from [Europe](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe/) by the waterways of the Turkish Straits and the watershed of the Greater Caucasus. Central Asia lies to its northeast, while South Asia lies to its east. Twelve seas surround the region (clockwise): the Aegean Sea, the Sea of Marmara, the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman, the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aqaba, the Gulf of Suez, and the [Mediterranean Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea/). The area contains the vast majority of the similarly defined Middle East, but excluding most of Egypt and the northwestern part of Turkey, and including the southern part of the Caucasus.
