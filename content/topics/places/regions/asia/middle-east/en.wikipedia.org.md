excerpt: >-
  The **Middle East** (term originally coined in English) is a geopolitical region encompassing the Arabian Peninsula, the Levant, Turkey, Egypt, [Iran](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran/), and Iraq. The term came into widespread usage as a replacement of the term Near East (as opposed to the Far East) beginning in the early 20th century. The term "Middle East" has led to some confusion over its changing definitions, and being seen as too Eurocentric. The region includes the vast majority of the territories included in the closely associated definition of West Asia, but without the South Caucasus, and additionally includes all of Egypt (not just the Sinai) and all of Turkey (not just the part barring East Thrace).
