  The northern region of [Europe](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe/) has several definitions. A restrictive definition may describe Northern Europe as being roughly north of the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, which is about 54Â°N, or may be based on other geographical factors such as climate and ecology.
