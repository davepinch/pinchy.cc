  **Oceania** (UK: /ˌoʊsiˈɑːniə, ˌoʊʃi-, -ˈeɪn-/ *OH-s(h)ee-AH-nee-ə, -⁠AY-*, US: /ˌoʊʃiˈæniə, -ˈɑːn-/ *OH-shee-A(H)N-ee-ə*) is a geographical region including Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. Outside of the English-speaking world, Oceania is generally considered a continent, while Mainland Australia is regarded as its continental landmass. Spanning the Eastern and Western hemispheres, at the centre of the water hemisphere, Oceania is estimated to have a land area of about 9,000,000 square kilometres (3,500,000 sq mi) and a population of around 44.4 million as of 2022. Oceania is the smallest continent in land area and the second-least populated after Antarctica.
