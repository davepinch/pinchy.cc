excerpt: >-
  The **Pacific Northwest** (**PNW**), sometimes referred to as **Cascadia**, is a geographic region in western [North America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America/) bounded by its coastal waters of the [Pacific Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean/) to the west and, loosely, by the Rocky Mountains to the east. Though no official boundary exists, the most common conception includes the U.S. states of [Oregon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon/), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/), and [Idaho](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho/), and the Canadian province of [British Columbia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia/). Some broader conceptions reach north into [Alaska](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska/) and Yukon, south into northern [California](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California/), and east into western [Montana](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana/). Other conceptions may be limited to the coastal areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains. The variety of definitions can be attributed to partially overlapping commonalities of the region's history, culture, geography, society, ecosystems, and other factors.
