excerpt: >-
  **Central America** is a subregion of [North America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America/). Its political boundaries are defined as bordering [Mexico](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico/) to the north, [Colombia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia/) to the south, the [Caribbean Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Sea/) to the east, and the [Pacific Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean/) to the west. Central America is usually defined as consisting of seven countries: Belize, [Costa Rica](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica/), El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and [Panama](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama/). Within Central America is the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, which extends from northern Guatemala to central Panama. Due to the presence of several active geologic faults and the Central America Volcanic Arc, there is a high amount of seismic activity in the region, such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, which has resulted in death, injury, and property damage.
