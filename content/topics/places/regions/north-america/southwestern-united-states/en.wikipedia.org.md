  The **Southwestern United States**, also known as the American Southwest or simply the Southwest, is a geographic and cultural region of the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) that includes [Arizona](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona) and [New Mexico](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico), along with adjacent portions of [California](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California), [Colorado](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado), [Nevada](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada), [Oklahoma](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma), [Texas](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas), and [Utah](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah). The largest cities by metropolitan area are Phoenix, Las Vegas, El Paso, [Albuquerque](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico), and Tucson. Before 1848, in the historical region of Santa Fe de Nuevo México as well as parts of Alta California and Coahuila y Tejas, settlement was almost non-existent outside of Nuevo México's Pueblos and Spanish or Mexican municipalities. Much of the area had been a part of New Spain and Mexico until the United States acquired the area through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 and the smaller Gadsden Purchase in 1854.
