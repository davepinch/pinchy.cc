title: "The Palouse Ecoregion (storymaps.arcgis.com)"
author: Kristy Snyder
excerpt: >-
  The Palouse Prairie is an endangered ecosystem spanning Eastern Washington, Western Idaho, and Northeastern Washington (Noss et al. 1995). Different sources have a variety of historical ranges throughout this region. The most widely accepted historical range was created by Black et al. 1998. Black’s map displays the extensive loss of the Palouse Prairie’s range due to agricultural land conversion. Many of these maps are fairly old paper maps. Interactive, online maps of this region are lacking and needed.
