It is bordered by the state of [New York](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)/) to the west and by the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick to the northeast and Quebec to the north. The [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean/) is to the east and southeast, and Long Island Sound is to the southwest. [Boston](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston/) is New England's largest city, as well as the capital of Massachusetts.
