  The **Bering Sea** (/ˈbɛərɪŋ, ˈbɛrɪŋ/ *BAIR-ing*, *BERR-ing*, US also /ˈbɪərɪŋ/ *BEER-ing*; Russian: Бе́рингово мо́ре, romanized: *Béringovo móre*, IPA: [ˈbʲerʲɪnɡəvə ˈmorʲe]) is a marginal sea of the Northern Pacific Ocean. It forms, along with the Bering Strait, the divide between the two largest landmasses on Earth: Eurasia and the Americas. It comprises a deep water basin, which then rises through a narrow slope into the shallower water above the continental shelves. The Bering Sea is named after Vitus Bering, a Danish-born Russian navigator, who, in 1728, was the first European to systematically explore it, sailing from the Pacific Ocean northward to the Arctic Ocean.
