excerpt: >-
  The **Aegean Sea** is an elongated embayment of the [Mediterranean Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea/) between Europe and Asia. It is located between the Balkans and Anatolia, and covers an area of some 215,000 km2 (83,000 sq mi). In the north, the Aegean is connected to the Marmara Sea, which in turn connects to the [Black Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea/), by the straits of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus, respectively. The Aegean Islands are located within the sea and some bound it on its southern periphery, including Crete and Rhodes. The sea reaches a maximum depth of 2,639 m (8,658 ft) to the west of Karpathos. The Thracian Sea and the Sea of Crete are main subdivisions of the Aegean Sea.
