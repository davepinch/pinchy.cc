excerpt: >-
  The **Red Sea** is a sea inlet of the [Indian Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean/), lying between [Africa](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa/) and [Asia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia/). Its connection to the ocean is in the south, through the Bab-el-Mandeb strait and the Gulf of Aden. To its north lie the Sinai Peninsula, the [Gulf of Aqaba](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Aqaba/), and the Gulf of Suez (leading to the Suez Canal). It is underlain by the Red Sea Rift, which is part of the Great Rift Valley.
