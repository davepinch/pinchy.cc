excerpt: >-
  The **Sea of Azov** (Crimean Tatar: *Azaq deñizi*; Russian: Азовское море, romanized: *Azovskoye more*; Ukrainian: Азовське море, romanized: *Azovs'ke more*; Adyghe: Хы мыутӏэ, romanized: *Xı mıut’ə*) is an inland shelf sea in Eastern Europe connected to the [Black Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea/) by the narrow (about 4 km (2.5 mi)) Strait of Kerch, and is sometimes regarded as a northern extension of the Black Sea. The sea is bounded by [Russia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia/) on the east, and by [Ukraine](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine/) on the northwest and southwest, currently under Russian occupation. It is an important access route for Central Asia, from the Caspian Sea via the Volga–Don Canal.
