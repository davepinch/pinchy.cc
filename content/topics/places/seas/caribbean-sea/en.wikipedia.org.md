  The **Caribbean Sea** is a sea of the [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean/) in the tropics of the Western Hemisphere. It is bounded by [Mexico](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico/) and Central America to the west and southwest, to the north by the Greater Antilles starting with Cuba, to the east by the Lesser Antilles, and to the south by the northern coast of [South America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America/). The Gulf of Mexico lies to the northwest. The entire Caribbean Sea area, the numerous islands of the West Indies, and adjacent mainland coastal regions are collectively known as the Caribbean.
