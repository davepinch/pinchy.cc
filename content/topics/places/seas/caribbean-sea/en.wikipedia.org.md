It is bounded by [Mexico](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico/) and [Central America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America/) to the west and southwest, to the north by the Greater Antilles starting with Cuba, to the east by the Lesser Antilles, and to the south by the northern coast of [South America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America/). The [Gulf of Mexico](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico/) lies to the northwest.
