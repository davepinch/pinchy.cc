excerpt: >-
  The **Black Sea** is a marginal mediterranean sea lying between [Europe](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe/) and [Asia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia/), east of the Balkans, south of the East European Plain, west of the Caucasus, and north of Anatolia. It is bounded by [Bulgaria](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria/), [Georgia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)/), [Romania](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania/), [Russia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia/), [Turkey](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey/), and [Ukraine](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine/). The Black Sea is supplied by major rivers, principally the Danube, Dnieper and Dniester. Consequently, while six countries have a coastline on the sea, its drainage basin includes parts of 24 countries in Europe.
