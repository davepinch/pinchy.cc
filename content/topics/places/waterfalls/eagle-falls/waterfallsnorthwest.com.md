excerpt: >-
  The Skykomish River starts its trio of large, frothy waterfalls with a thunderous cascade in a steep sided gorge, right next to the highway. Data I encountered (I think from the WDFW but I can't remember) placed the height of the falls at 22 feet. I recently measured it at 18 feet, but that was at high flows when much of the falls were flooded over. These falls themselves are not terribly interesting, but since they are located immediately next to the road, it's easy to reach, and when the river is running even moderately high, it's an impressive stretch of whitewater.
