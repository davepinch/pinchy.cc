excerpt: >-
  Youngs Creek crashes through potholes into a small gorge very similar to the gorge downstream of Youngs Creek Falls, just 1/2 mile downstream. The difference being, the falls are visible from the road this time. The falls are viewed from a concrete bridge spanning Young Creek, the road leading to Cedar Ponds Lake and it's surrounding houses. Best views are however from underneath the bridge (where your view will undoubtedly be graced with many exotic pink flag-tape flowers). Be careful on the slopes near the gorge though, they are crumbly and unstable - especially when wet.
