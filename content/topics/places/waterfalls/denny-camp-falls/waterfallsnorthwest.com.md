excerpt: >-
  Denny Camp Falls is likely the largest of a number of small waterfalls found both above and below Franklin Falls along the South Fork Snoqualmie River. Conveniently this waterfall happens to be situated almost immediately to a road and features quite easy access (though clear views require a bit of less-than-easy scrambling). The river here constricts between narrow gorge walls and plunges 27 feet into a small bowl flanked by dark mossy cliffs. Because of the constricted gorge walls, the Franklin Falls trail which passes the falls has to divert almost quite literally onto Denny Creek Road #58, and this fortunately facilitates quick in-and-out access for those looking to visit several waterfalls in the area in one day.
