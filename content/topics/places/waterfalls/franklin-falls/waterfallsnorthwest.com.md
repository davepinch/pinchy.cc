excerpt: >-
  Franklin Falls is the uppermost waterfall along the South Fork Snoqualmie River which bears an officially recognized name, as well as developed trail access. More uniquely the falls have the distinct characteristic of being situated in between the east and west lanes of Interstate 90, with the westbound lanes crossing a talus slope directly above the falls on a high viaduct. Compounding this surprisingly unobtrusive influence of man, the trail to the falls is among the most popular in the Snoqualmie Pass area thanks to its ease and kid-friendliness.
