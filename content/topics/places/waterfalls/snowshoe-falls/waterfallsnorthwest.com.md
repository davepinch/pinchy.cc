excerpt: >-
  Snowshoe Falls is the largest waterfall along Denny Creek, but because it's both difficult to access from below, and very hard to see from above, it doesn't receive nearly the amount of attention that neighboring Keekwulee Falls does. Snowshoe Falls is tucked at the head of a narrow gorge, about Â½ mile upstream from Keekwulee Falls, but because of the steepness of the canyon walls, it's much more difficult to see the falls in entirety.
