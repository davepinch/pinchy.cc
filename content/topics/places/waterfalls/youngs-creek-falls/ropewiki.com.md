excerpt: >-
  Youngs Creek Falls is a collection of small punchbowl waterfalls that carve a narrow gorge into the surrounding rock. It is very accessible and visible from the road. There is one rappel, and an small optional jump. Because of how short the canyon is, it's a perfect place to visit weekdays after work.
