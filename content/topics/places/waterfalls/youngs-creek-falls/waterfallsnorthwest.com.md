excerpt: >-
  If you were driving along Highway 203 to or from Monroe, you will undoubtedly see the vast farmlands along the shores of the Snoqualmie and Skykomish Rivers, totally oblivious that there are waterfalls around. Youngs Creek Falls seems quite out of place, until you actually reach the creek. It seems like the road and valley should be somewhere in lowlands eastern Washington. During low water periods, the falls may become tiered. This is the only waterfall that I know of that loses a tier in high water. It is possible, however, that when I saw the falls as tiered, there was a large root wad at the falls' base, causing the appearance of a second tier.
