  The **Falkland Islands** (/ˈfɔː(l)klənd, ˈfɒlk-/ FAW(L)K-lənd, FOLK-; Spanish: Islas Malvinas [ˈislas malˈβinas]) is an archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean on the Patagonian Shelf. The principal islands are about 300 mi (480 km) east of [South America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America/)'s southern Patagonian coast and about 752 mi (1,210 km) from Cape Dubouzet at the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, at a latitude of about 52°S. The archipelago, with an area of 4,700 sq mi (12,000 km2), comprises East Falkland, West Falkland, and 776 smaller islands. As a British overseas territory, the Falklands have internal self-governance, but the [United Kingdom](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom/) takes responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs. The capital and largest settlement is Stanley on East Falkland.
