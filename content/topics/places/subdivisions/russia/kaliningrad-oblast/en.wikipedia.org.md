  **Kaliningrad Oblast** (Russian: Калининградская область, romanized: Kaliningradskaya oblastʹ) is the westernmost federal subject of the [Russian Federation](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia/). It is a semi-exclave situated on the Baltic Sea. The oblast is surrounded by two European Union and NATO members: [Poland](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland/) to the south and [Lithuania](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania/) to the north and east. Its coastline faces the [Baltic Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea/) to the northwest and a maritime border with [Sweden](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden/) to the west. The largest city and administrative centre of the province (oblast) is the city of Kaliningrad, formerly known as Königsberg. The port city of Baltiysk is Russia's only port on the Baltic Sea that remains ice-free in winter. Kaliningrad Oblast had a population of roughly 1 million in the Russian Census of 2021.
