  The **West Bank** (Arabic: الضفة الغربية, romanized: *aḍ-Ḍiffah al-Ġarbiyyah*; Hebrew: הַגָּדָה הַמַּעֲרָבִית, romanized: *HaGadáh HaMaʽarávit*), so called due to its relation to the Jordan River, is the larger of the two [Palestinian territories](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories/) (the other being the [Gaza Strip](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip/)). A landlocked territory near the coast of the [Mediterranean Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea/) in the Levant region of [West Asia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Asia/), it is bordered by [Jordan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan/) and the Dead Sea to the east and by [Israel](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel/) (via the Green Line) to the south, west, and north. The territory has been under Israeli occupation since 1967.
