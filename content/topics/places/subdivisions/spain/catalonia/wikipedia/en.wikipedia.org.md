  **Catalonia** (/ˌkætəˈloʊniə/; Catalan: *Catalunya* [kətəˈluɲə]; Spanish: Cataluña [kataˈluɲa]; Occitan: *Catalonha* [kataˈluɲa]) is an autonomous community of Spain, designated as a nationality by its Statute of Autonomy. Most of its territory (except the Val d'Aran) lies on the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula, to the south of the Pyrenees mountain range. Catalonia is administratively divided into four provinces or eight vegueries (regions), which are in turn divided into 42 *comarques*. The capital and largest city, Barcelona, is the second-most populous municipality in Spain and the fifth-most populous urban area in the European Union.
