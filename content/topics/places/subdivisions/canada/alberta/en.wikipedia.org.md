  **Alberta** (/ælˈbɜːrtə/ al-BUR-tə) is one of the thirteen provinces and territories of [Canada](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada/). It is a part of Western Canada and is one of the three prairie provinces. Alberta borders [British Columbia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia/) to the west, [Saskatchewan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan/) to the east, the [Northwest Territories](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Territories/) to the north, and the U.S. state of Montana to the south. It is one of the only two landlocked provinces in Canada, with Saskatchewan being the other. The eastern part of the province is occupied by the Great Plains, while the western part borders the Rocky Mountains. The province has a predominantly continental climate but experiences quick temperature changes due to air aridity. Seasonal temperature swings are less pronounced in western Alberta due to occasional Chinook winds.
