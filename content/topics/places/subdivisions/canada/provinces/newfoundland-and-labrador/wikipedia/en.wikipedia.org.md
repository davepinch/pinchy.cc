  **Newfoundland and Labrador** (/ˈnjuːfən(d)lənd ... ˈlæbrədɔːr, -lænd ... / *NEW-fən(d)-lənd* ... *LAB-rə-dor, -⁠land*..., locally /ˌnjuːfənˈlænd ... / *NEW-fən-LAND* ...; French: *Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador*; frequently abbreviated as **NL**) is the easternmost province of [Canada](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada/), in the country's Atlantic region. The province comprises the island of Newfoundland and the continental region of Labrador, having a total size of 405,212 square kilometres (156,500 sq mi). In 2023, the population of Newfoundland and Labrador was estimated to be 533,710. The island of Newfoundland (and its smaller neighbouring islands) is home to around 94 per cent of the province's population, with more than half residing in the Avalon Peninsula. Labrador borders the province of Quebec, and the French overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon lies about 20 km (12 mi) west of the Burin Peninsula.
