  **Quebec** (English: Quebec; French: Québec [kebɛk] is one of the thirteen provinces and territories of [Canada]([Canada](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada/)). It is the largest province by area and the second-largest by population. Much of the population lives in urban areas along the St. Lawrence River, between its most populous city, Montreal, and the provincial capital, Quebec City. Located in Central Canada, the province shares land borders with [Ontario](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario/) to the west, [Newfoundland and Labrador](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_and_Labrador/) to the northeast, [New Brunswick](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Brunswick/) to the southeast, and a coastal border with [Nunavut](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunavut/); in the south it borders the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States/).
