  **British Columbia** (commonly abbreviated as **BC**) is the westernmost province of [Canada](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada/). Situated between the [Pacific Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean/) and the Rocky Mountains, the province has a diverse geography, with rugged landscapes that include rocky coastlines, sandy beaches, forests, lakes, mountains, inland deserts and grassy plains. British Columbia borders the province of [Alberta](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta/) to the east, the territories of [Yukon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukon/) and the [Northwest Territories](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Territories/) to the north, and the US states of [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/), [Idaho](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho/) and [Montana](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana/) to the south and [Alaska](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska/) to the northwest. With an estimated population of over 5.3 million as of 2023, it is Canada's third-most populous province. The capital of British Columbia is Victoria, while the province's largest city is Vancouver. Vancouver and its suburbs together make up the third-largest metropolitan area in Canada; with the 2021 census recording 2.6 million people in Metro Vancouver.
