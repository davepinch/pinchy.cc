excerpt: >-
  **North Dakota** ( /- dəˈkoʊtə/) is a U.S. state in the [Upper Midwest](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Midwest/), named after the indigenous Dakota Sioux. It is bordered by the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba to the north and by the U.S. states of [Minnesota](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota/) to the east, [South Dakota](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota/) to the south, and [Montana](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana/) to the west. North Dakota is part of the Great Plains region, characterized by broad prairies, steppe, temperate savanna, badlands, and farmland. It is believed to host the geographic center of North America, Rugby, and is home to the tallest artificial structure in the Western Hemisphere, the KVLY-TV mast.
