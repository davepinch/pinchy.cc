  **New Jersey** is a state in the [Mid-Atlantic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_(United_States)/) and [Northeastern](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States/) regions of the United States. It is bordered on the north and east by the state of [New York](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)/); on the east, southeast, and south by the [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean/); on the west by the Delaware River and [Pennsylvania](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania/); and on the southwest by Delaware Bay and the state of [Delaware](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware/). At 7,354 square miles (19,050 km2), New Jersey is the fifth-smallest state in land area; but with close to 9.3 million residents, it ranks 11th in population and first in population density. The state capital is Trenton, and the most populous city is Newark.
