  **New Jersey** is a state in the [Mid-Atlantic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_(United_States)/) and [Northeastern](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States/) regions of the United States. It is bordered on the north and east by the state of [New York](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)/); on the east, southeast, and south by the [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean/); on the west by the Delaware River and [Pennsylvania](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania/); and on the southwest by Delaware Bay and the state of [Delaware](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware/). At 7,354 square miles (19,050 km2), New Jersey is the fifth-smallest state in land area; but with close to 9.3 million residents, it ranks 11th in population and first in population density. The state capital is Trenton, and the most populous city is Newark. With the exception of Warren County, all of the state's 21 counties lie within the combined statistical areas of New York City or Philadelphia.
