excerpt: >-
  **Rhode Island** (/ˌroʊd-/, like road) is a state in the [New England](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England/) region of the [Northeastern United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States/). It is the smallest U.S. state by area and the seventh-least populous, with slightly less than 1.1 million residents as of 2020; but Rhode Island has grown at every decennial count since 1790 and is the second-most densely populated state, after [New Jersey](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey/). The state takes its name from the eponymous island, though nearly all of its land area is on the mainland. Rhode Island borders [Connecticut](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut/) to its west; [Massachusetts](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts/) to its north and east; and the [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean/) to its south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound; and shares a small maritime border with [New York](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)/), east of Long Island. Providence is its capital and most populous city.
