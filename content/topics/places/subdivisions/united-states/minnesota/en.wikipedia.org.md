  **Minnesota** (/ˌmɪnɪˈsoʊtə/ (listen)) is a state in the [Upper Midwestern](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Midwest) region of the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). It is the 12th largest U.S. state in area and the 22nd most populous, with over 5.75 million residents. Minnesota is home to western prairies, now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed, and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Roughly a third of the state is covered in forests, and it is known as the "Land of 10,000 Lakes" for having over 14,000 bodies of fresh water covering at least ten acres each. More than 60% of Minnesotans live in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area, known as the "Twin Cities", the state's main political, economic, and cultural hub. With a population of about 3.7 million, the Twin Cities is the 16th largest metropolitan area in the U.S. Other minor metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas in the state include [Duluth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duluth,_Minnesota), Mankato, Moorhead, Rochester, and St. Cloud.
