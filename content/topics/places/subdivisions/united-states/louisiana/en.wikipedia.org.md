  **Louisiana** (French: *La Louisiane* [la lwizjan]; Spanish: *La Luisiana*) is a state in the Deep South and South Central regions of the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). It is bordered by the state of [Texas](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas) to the west, [Arkansas](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas) to the north, [Mississippi](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi) to the east, and the [Gulf of Mexico](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico) to the south; a large part of its eastern boundary is demarcated by the [Mississippi River](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River). Of the 50 U.S. states, it ranks 20th in land area and the 25th in population, with roughly 4.6 million residents. Reflecting its French heritage, Louisiana is the only U.S. state with political subdivisions termed parishes, which are equivalent to counties, making it one of only two U.S. states not subdivided into counties (the other being [Alaska](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska) and its boroughs). The state's capital is Baton Rouge, and its largest city is [New Orleans](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans), with a population of roughly 383,000 people.
