  **Idaho** (/ˈaɪdəhoʊ/ *EYE-də-hoh*) is a state in the [Pacific Northwest](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest) region of the [Western United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States). To the north, it shares a small portion of the Canada–United States border with the province of [British Columbia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia). It borders the states of [Montana](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana) and [Wyoming](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming) to the east, [Nevada](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada) and [Utah](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah) to the south, and [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)) and [Oregon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon) to the west. The state's capital and largest city is Boise. With an area of 83,570 square miles (216,400 km2), Idaho is the 14th largest state by land area, but with a population of approximately 1.8 million, it ranks as the 13th least populous and the 7th least densely populated of the 50 U.S. states.
