To the north, it shares a small portion of the Canada–United States border with the province of [British Columbia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia). It borders the states of [Montana](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana) and [Wyoming](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming) to the east, [Nevada](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada) and [Utah](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah) to the south, and [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)) and [Oregon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon) to the west.
