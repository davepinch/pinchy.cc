  **Vermont** (/vərˈmɒnt/) is a state in the [New England](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England) region of the [Northeastern United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States/). Vermont is bordered by the states of [Massachusetts](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts) to the south, [New Hampshire](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire) to the east, [New York](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)) to the west, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north.
