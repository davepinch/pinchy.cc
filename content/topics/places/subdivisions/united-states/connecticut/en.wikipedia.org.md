  **Connecticut** (/kəˈnɛtɪkət/ kə-NET-ik-ət) is the southernmost state in the [New England](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England/) region of the [Northeastern United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States/). As of the 2020 United States census, Connecticut was home to over 3.6 million residents, its highest decennial count ever, growing every decade since 1790. The state is bordered by [Rhode Island](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island/) to its east, [Massachusetts](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts/) to its north, [New York](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)/) to its west, and Long Island Sound to its south. Its capital is Hartford, and its most populous city is Bridgeport. Historically, the state is part of New England as well as the tri-state area with New York and New Jersey. The state is named for the Connecticut River which approximately bisects the state. The word Connecticut is derived from various anglicized spellings of Quinnetuket, a Mohegan-Pequot word for "long tidal river".
