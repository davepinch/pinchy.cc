excerpt: >-
  **Alaska** is by far the largest state of the United States of America by land area. Nicknamed "the last frontier", Alaska is sparsely populated with a harsh climate but incredible scenery. Separated from the "lower 48" by Canada, Alaska can be a challenging destination; most of the state is in the Arctic. Besides vast forests and frozen tundra, Alaska contains the ten highest mountain peaks in the United States, including Denali, the highest in all of North America.
