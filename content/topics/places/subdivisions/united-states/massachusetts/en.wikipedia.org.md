  **Massachusetts** (/ˌmæsəˈtʃuːsɪts/ *MASS-ə-CHOO-sits*, /-zɪts/ *-⁠zits*; Massachusett: Muhsachuweesut [məhswatʃəwiːsət]), officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is a state in the [New England](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England) region of the [Northeastern United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States/). It borders the [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean/) and Gulf of Maine to its east, [Connecticut](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut/) and [Rhode Island](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island/) to its south, [New Hampshire](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire/) and [Vermont](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont/) to its north, and [New York](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)/) to its west. Massachusetts is the sixth smallest state by land area, but with over 7 million residents, it is the most populous state in New England, the 15th most populous in the country, and the third most densely populated, after [New Jersey](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey/) and Rhode Island. The state's capital and most populous city, as well as its cultural and financial center, is [Boston](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston/). Massachusetts is also home to the urban core of Greater Boston, the largest metropolitan area in New England and a region profoundly influential upon American history, academia, and the research economy. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing, and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, the state's economy shifted from manufacturing to services, and in the 21st century it is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.
