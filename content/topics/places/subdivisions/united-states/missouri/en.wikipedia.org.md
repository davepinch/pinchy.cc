  **Missouri** is a state in the [Midwestern](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States/) region of the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States/). Ranking 21st in land area, it is bordered by eight states (tied for the most with Tennessee): [Iowa](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa/) to the north, [Illinois](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois/), [Kentucky](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky/) and [Tennessee](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee/) to the east, [Arkansas](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas/) to the south and [Oklahoma](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma/), [Kansas](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas/) and [Nebraska](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska/) to the west. In the south are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Missouri River, after which the state is named, flows through the center into the [Mississippi River](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River/), which makes up the eastern border. With more than six million residents, it is the 19th-most populous state of the country. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield and Columbia; the capital is Jefferson City.
