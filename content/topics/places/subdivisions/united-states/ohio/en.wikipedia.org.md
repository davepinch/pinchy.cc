  **Ohio** (/oʊˈhaɪoʊ/) is a state in the [Midwestern](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States/) region of the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). Of the fifty U.S. states, it is the 34th-largest by area, and with a population of nearly 11.8 million, is the seventh-most populous and tenth-most densely populated. The state's capital and largest city is Columbus, with the Columbus metro area, Greater Cincinnati, and Greater Cleveland being the largest metropolitan areas. Ohio is bordered by [Lake Erie](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Erie/) to the north, [Pennsylvania](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania/) to the east, [West Virginia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia/) to the southeast, [Kentucky](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky/) to the southwest, [Indiana](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana/) to the west, and [Michigan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan/) to the northwest. Ohio is historically known as the "Buckeye State" after its Ohio buckeye trees, and Ohioans are also known as "Buckeyes". Its state flag is the only non-rectangular flag of all the U.S. states.
