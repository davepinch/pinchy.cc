  The **Mariana Plate** is a micro tectonic plate located west of the Mariana Trench which forms the basement of the Mariana Islands which form part of the Izu–Bonin–Mariana Arc. It is separated from the [Philippine Sea Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Sea_Plate/) to the west by a divergent boundary with numerous transform fault offsets. The boundary between the Mariana and the [Pacific Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Plate/) to the east is a subduction zone with the Pacific Plate subducting beneath the Mariana. This eastern subduction is divided into the Mariana Trench, which forms the southeastern boundary, and the Izu–Ogasawara Trench the northeastern boundary. The subduction plate motion is responsible for the shape of the Mariana plate and back arc.
