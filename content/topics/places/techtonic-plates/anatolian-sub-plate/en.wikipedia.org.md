excerpt: >-
  The **Anatolian Sub-Plate** is a continental tectonic plate that is separated from the [Eurasian plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Plate/) and the [Arabian plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Plate/) by the North Anatolian Fault and the East Anatolian Fault respectively. Most of the country of [Turkey](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey/) is located on the Anatolian plate. Most significant earthquakes in the region have historically occurred along the northern fault, such as the 1939 Erzincan earthquake. The devastating 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake occurred along the active East Anatolian fault at a strike slip fault where the Arabian plate is sliding past the Anatolian plate horizontally.
