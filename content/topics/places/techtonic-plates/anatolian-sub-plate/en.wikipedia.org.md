excerpt: >-
  The **Anatolian Sub-Plate** is a continental tectonic plate that is separated from the [Eurasian plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Plate/) and the [Arabian plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Plate/) by the North Anatolian Fault and the East Anatolian Fault respectively. Most of the country of [Turkey](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey/) is located on the Anatolian plate. Most significant earthquakes in the region have historically occurred along the northern fault, such as the 1939 Erzincan earthquake. The devastating 2023 Turkeyâ€“Syria earthquake occurred along the active East Anatolian fault at a strike slip fault where the Arabian plate is sliding past the Anatolian plate horizontally.
