excerpt: >-
  The **Bird's Head Plate** is a minor tectonic plate incorporating the Bird's Head Peninsula, at the western end of the island of New Guinea. Hillis and MÃ¼ller consider it to be moving in unison with the [Pacific Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Plate/). P. Bird considers it to be unconnected to the Pacific Plate.
