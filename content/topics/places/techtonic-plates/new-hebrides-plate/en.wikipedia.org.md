excerpt: >-
  The **New Hebrides Plate**, sometimes called the **Neo-Hebridean Plate**, is a minor tectonic plate (just larger than a microplate) located in the [Pacific Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean/). While most of it is submerged as the sea bottom of the North Fiji Basin, the island country of Vanuatu, with multiple arc volcanoes, is on the western edge of the plate. It is bounded on the south-west by the [Australian Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Plate/), which is subducting below it at the New Hebrides Trench. The Vanuatu subduction zone is seismically active, producing many earthquakes of magnitude 7 or higher. To its north is the [Pacific Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Plate/), north-east the [Balmoral Reef Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balmoral_Reef_Plate/) and to its east the [Conway Reef Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway_Reef_Plate/).
