excerpt: >-
  The **Niuafo'ou Plate** is a small tectonic plate located west of the islands of Tonga. This plate is sandwiched between the [Pacific Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Plate/) to the north, the very unstable [Tonga Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonga_Plate/) to the east and the [Australian Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Plate/) to the west. It is primarily surrounded by divergent boundaries. This plate is riddled with active faults thus making the area extremely earthquake prone.
