  The **Caroline Plate** is a minor tectonic plate that straddles the Equator in the eastern hemisphere located north of New Guinea. It forms a subduction zone along the border with the Bird's Head Plate and other minor plates of the New Guinea region to the south. A transform boundary forms the northern border with the Pacific Plate. Along the border with the [Philippine Sea Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Sea_Plate/) is a convergent boundary that transitions into a rift.
