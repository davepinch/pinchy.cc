excerpt: >-
  The **Juan de Fuca Plate** is a small tectonic plate (microplate) generated from the Juan de Fuca Ridge that is subducting beneath the northerly portion of the western side of the [North American Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Plate/) at the [Cascadia subduction zone](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascadia_subduction_zone/). It is named after the explorer of the same name. One of the smallest of [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth)'s tectonic plates, the Juan de Fuca Plate is a remnant part of the once-vast [Farallon Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farallon_Plate), which is now largely subducted underneath the North American Plate.
