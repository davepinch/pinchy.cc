  The **Juan Fernandez Plate** is a small tectonic plate (microplate) in the [Pacific Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean/). With a surface area of approximately 105 km2, the microplate is located between 32° and 35°S and 109° and 112°W. The plate is located at a triple junction between the [Antarctic Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Plate/), the [Nazca Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazca_Plate/), and the [Pacific Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Plate/). Approximately 2,000 km to the west of South America, it is, on average, 3,000 meters deep with its shallowest point coming to approximately 1,600 meters, and its deepest point reaching 4,400 meters.
