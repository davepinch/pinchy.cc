excerpt: >-
  The **Galapagos Microplate** (**GMP**) is a geological feature of the oceanic crust located at 1°50' N, offshore of the west coast of [Colombia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia/). The GMP is collocated with the Galapagos Triple Junction, which is an atypical ridge-ridge-ridge triple junction. At the Galapagos Triple Junction, the [Pacific Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Plate/), [Cocos Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocos_Plate/), and [Nazca Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazca_Plate/) meet incompletely, forming two counter-rotating microplates at the junction of the Cocos-Nazca, Pacific-Cocos, and Pacific-Nazca spreading ridges.
