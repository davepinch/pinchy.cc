excerpt: >-
  The **Timor Plate** is a small tectonic plate (microplate) in [Southeast Asia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia/) carrying the island of Timor and surrounding islands. The [Australian Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Plate/) is subducting under the southern edge of the plate, while a small divergent boundary is located on the eastern edge. Another convergent boundary exists with the [Banda Sea Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banda_Sea_Plate/) to the north, and to the west is a transform boundary.
