  The **Yangtze Plate**, also called the South China Block or the South China Subplate, comprises the bulk of southern [China](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China/). It is separated on the east from the [Okinawa Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawa_Plate/) by a rift that forms the Okinawa Trough which is a back-arc basin, on the south by the [Sunda Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunda_Plate/) and the [Philippine Sea Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Sea_Plate/), and on the north and west by the [Eurasian Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Plate/). The Longmenshan Fault on the latter border was the site of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake.
