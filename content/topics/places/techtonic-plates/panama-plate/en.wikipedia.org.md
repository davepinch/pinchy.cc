excerpt: >-
  The **Panama Plate** is a small tectonic plate (microplate) that exists between two actively spreading ridges and moves relatively independently of its surrounding plates. The Panama Plate is located between the [Cocos Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocos_Plate/) and the [Nazca Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazca_Plate/) to the south and the [Caribbean Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Plate/) to the north. Most of its borders are convergent boundaries, including a subduction zone to the west. It consists, for the most part, of the countries of [Costa Rica](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica/) and [Panama](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama/).
