  The **Phoenix Plate** (also known as the **Aluk Plate** or **Drake Plate**) was a tectonic plate that existed during the early Paleozoic through late Cenozoic time. It formed a triple junction with the Izanagi and [Farallon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farallon_Plate/) plates in the [Panthalassa Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthalassa/) as early as 410 million years ago, during which time the Phoenix Plate was subducting under eastern Gondwana.
