excerpt: >-
  The **Australian Plate** is a major tectonic plate in the eastern and, largely, southern hemispheres. Originally a part of the ancient continent of Gondwana, Australia remained connected to [India](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Plate/) and [Antarctica](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Plate/) until approximately 100 million years ago when India broke away and began moving north. Australia and Antarctica had begun rifting by 96 million years ago and completely separated a while after this, some believing as recently as 45 million years ago, but most accepting presently that this had occurred by 60 million years ago.
