excerpt: >-
  The **North Andes Plate** or **North Andes Block** is a small tectonic plate (microplate) located in the northern Andes. It is squeezed between the faster moving [South American Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_American_Plate/) and the [Nazca Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazca_Plate/) to the southwest. Due to the subduction of the Coiba and Malpelo plates, this area is very prone to volcanic and seismic activity, with many historical earthquakes.
