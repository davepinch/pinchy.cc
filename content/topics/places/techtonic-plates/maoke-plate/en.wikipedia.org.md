  The **Maoke Plate** is a small tectonic plate located in western New Guinea underlying the Sudirman Range from which the highest mountain on the island- Puncak Jaya rises. To its east was proposed a convergent boundary with the [Woodlark Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodlark_Plate/), although this is now best modelled after further studies as a boundary with an enlarged [Solomon Sea Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Sea_Plate/) or a new microplate called the [Trobriand Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trobriand_Plate/). To the south lies a transform boundary with the [Australian Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Plate/) and the [Bird's Head Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird's_Head_Plate/) lies to the west.
