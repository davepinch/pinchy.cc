excerpt: >-
  The **Farallon Plate** was an ancient oceanic plate. It formed one of the three main plates of [Panthalassa](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthalassa/), alongside the Phoenix Plate and Izanagi Plate, which were connected by a triple junction. The Farallon Plate began subducting under the west coast of the North American Plate—then located in modern [Utah](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah/)—as [Pangaea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea/) broke apart and after the formation of the Pacific Plate at the centre of the triple junction during the [Early Jurassic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Jurassic/). It is named for the Farallon Islands, which are located just west of [San Francisco](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco/), [California](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California/).
