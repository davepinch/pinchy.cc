excerpt: >-
  The **Explorer Plate** is an oceanic tectonic plate beneath the [Pacific Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean/) off the west coast of [Vancouver Island](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Island/), Canada, which is partially subducted under the [North American Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Plate/). Along with the [Juan de Fuca Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_de_Fuca_Plate/) and Gorda Plate, the Explorer Plate is a remnant of the ancient [Farallon Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farallon_Plate/), which has been subducted under the North American Plate. The Explorer Plate separated from the Juan de Fuca Plate roughly 4 million years ago. In its smoother, southern half, the average depth of the Explorer plate is roughly 2,400 metres (7,900 ft) and rises up in its northern half to a highly variable basin between 1,400 metres (4,600 ft) and 2,200 metres (7,200 ft) in depth.
