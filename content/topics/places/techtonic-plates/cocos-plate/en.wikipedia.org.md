excerpt: >-
  The **Cocos Plate** is a young oceanic tectonic plate beneath the [Pacific Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean/) off the west coast of Central America, named for Cocos Island, which rides upon it. The Cocos Plate was created approximately 23 million years ago when the [Farallon Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farallon_Plate/) broke into two pieces, which also created the Nazca Plate. The Cocos Plate also broke into two pieces, creating the small Rivera Plate. The Cocos Plate is bounded by several different plates. To the northeast it is bounded by the [North American Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Plate/) and the [Caribbean Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Plate/). To the west it is bounded by the [Pacific Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Plate/) and to the south by the Nazca Plate.
