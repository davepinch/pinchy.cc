  The **Conway Reef Plate** is a small tectonic plate (microplate) located in the south [Pacific](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean/) west of Fiji. The western boundary is with the New Hebrides Plate while the eastern is with the [Australian Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Plate/). A short transform boundary also exists with the Balmoral Reef Plate. Much of the plate underlies the south central portion of the North Fiji Basin.
