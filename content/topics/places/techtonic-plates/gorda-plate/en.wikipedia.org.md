  The **Gorda Plate**, located beneath the Pacific Ocean off the coast of northern California, is one of the northern remnants of the [Farallon Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farallon_Plate/). It is sometimes referred to (by, for example, publications from the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program) as simply the southernmost portion of the neighboring [Juan de Fuca Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_de_Fuca_Plate/), another Farallon remnant.
