excerpt: >-
  The **Tonga Plate** is a small southwest Pacific tectonic plate or microplate. It is centered at approximately 19° S. latitude and 173° E. longitude. The plate is an elongated plate oriented NNE - SSW and is a northward continuation of the Kermadec linear zone north of New Zealand. The plate is bounded on the east and north by the [Pacific Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Plate/), on the northwest by the Niuafo’ou Microplate, on the west and south by the Indo-Australian Plate. The Tonga plate is subducting the [Pacific plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Plate/) along the Tonga Trench. This subduction turns into a transform fault boundary north of Tonga. An active rift or spreading center separates the Tonga Plate from the [Australian Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Plate/) and the [Niuafo’ou microplate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niuafo'ou_Plate/) to the west. The Tonga Plate is seismically very active and is rotating clockwise.
