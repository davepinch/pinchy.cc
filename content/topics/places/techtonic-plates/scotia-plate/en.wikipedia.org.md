  The **Scotia Plate** (Spanish: *Placa Scotia*) is a minor tectonic plate on the edge of the [South Atlantic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean/) and Southern oceans. Thought to have formed during the early [Eocene](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene/) with the opening of the [Drake Passage](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Passage/) that separates [Antarctica](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica/) and [South America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America/), it is a minor plate whose movement is largely controlled by the two major plates that surround it: the [Antarctic Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Plate/) and the [South American Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_American_Plate/). The Scotia Plate takes its name from the steam yacht Scotia of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition (1902â€“04), the expedition that made the first bathymetric study of the region.
