  The **Balmoral Reef Plate** is a small tectonic plate (microplate) located in the south [Pacific](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean/) north of Fiji. Clockwise from the north, it borders the [Pacific Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Plate/), the [Australian Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Plate/), Conway Reef Plate, and the New Hebrides Plate. The northern and western borders are a divergent boundary while the rest of the borders are transform and convergent boundaries. The Balmoral Reef Plate's ocean crust is less than 12 million years old and is spreading between the New Hebrides and Tonga subduction. The plate forms the west central part of the seafloor of the North Fiji Basin.
