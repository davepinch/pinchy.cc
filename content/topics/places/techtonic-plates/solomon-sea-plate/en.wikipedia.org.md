  The **Solomon Sea Plate** (also known as the **Solomon Plate**) is a minor tectonic plate to the northwest of the Solomon Islands archipelago in the south [Pacific Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean/). It roughly corresponds with the Solomon Sea east of Papua New Guinea. The plate boundaries are associated with high earthquake activity as part of the New Britain subduction zone.
