excerpt: >-
  The **Somali Plate** is a minor tectonic plate which straddles the Equator in the Eastern Hemisphere. It is currently in the process of separating from the [African Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Plate/) along the East African Rift Valley. It is approximately centered on the island of Madagascar and includes about half of the east coast of [Africa](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa/), from the Gulf of Aden in the north through the East African Rift Valley. The southern boundary with the Nubian-African Plate is a diffuse plate boundary consisting of the Lwandle Plate.
