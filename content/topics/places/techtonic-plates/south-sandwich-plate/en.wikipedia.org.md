excerpt: >-
  The **South Sandwich Plate** or the **Sandwich Plate** is a small tectonic plate (microplate) bounded by the subducting [South American Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_American_Plate/) to the east, the [Antarctic Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Plate/) to the south, and the Scotia Plate to the west. The plate is separated from the [Scotia Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotia_Plate/) by the East Scotia Rise, a back-arc spreading ridge formed by the subduction zone on its eastern margin. The South Sandwich Islands are located on this microplate.
