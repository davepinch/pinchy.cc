excerpt: >-
  The **Kermadec Plate** is a long and narrow tectonic plate located west of the Kermadec Trench in the south Pacific Ocean. Also included on this tectonic plate is a small portion of the North Island of New Zealand and the Kermadec Islands. It is separated from the [Australian Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Plate/) by a long divergent boundary which forms a back-arc basin. This area is highly prone to earthquakes and tsunamis.
