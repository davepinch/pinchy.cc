excerpt: >-
  **Easter Plate** is a tectonic microplate located to the west of Easter Island off the west coast of [South America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America/) in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, bordering the [Nazca Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazca_Plate/) to the east and the [Pacific Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Plate/) to the west. It was discovered from looking at earthquake distributions that were offset from the previously perceived Nazca-Pacific Divergent boundary. This young plate is 5.25 million years old and is considered a microplate because it is small with an area of approximately 160,000 square kilometres (62,000 sq mi). Seafloor spreading along the Easter microplate's borders have some of the highest global rates, ranging from 50 to 140 millimetres (2.0 to 5.5 in)/yr.
