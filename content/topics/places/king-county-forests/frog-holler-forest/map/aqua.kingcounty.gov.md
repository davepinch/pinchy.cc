excerpt: >-
  Known for the chorus of tree frogs in the area, Frog Holler is a local Vashon Island neighborhood along Wax Orchard Road just north of Camp Sealth.  The largest portion of Frog Holler Forest is one-half mile south of Bates Road on the east side of Wax Orchard Road.  The previous owners had enrolled the forest in the American Tree Farm system and allowed local neighbors to use the network of trails on site.  The site has a 5-acre pasture that had been grazed by sheep, goats and horses over the years.  A 39 acre parcel west of the road was added to the site in 2020.  Frog Holler Forest is the largest public forest on the south end of Vashon Island.
