  **Denny Blaine Park** is a 2 acres (8,100 m2) water-front park in the [Denny-Blaine](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denny-Blaine,_Seattle/) neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. With picturesque views of [Bellevue](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue,_Washington/) directly across the lake and [Mount Rainier](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rainier/) in the distance, it is primarily used for picnicking, sunbathing, and swimming. The park has also been one of [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle/)'s unofficial queer- and trans-friendly clothing optional beaches since the 1970s.
