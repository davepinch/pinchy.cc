excerpt: >-
  **Discovery Park** is a 534-acre (2.16 km2) park on the shores of [Puget Sound](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound/) in the [Magnolia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnolia,_Seattle/) neighborhood of [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle/), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/). As the city's largest public park, it contains 11.81 miles (19.01 km) of walking trails. The **Discovery Park Loop Trail**, designated a National Recreation Trail in 1975, runs 2.8 miles (4.5 km) through the park, connecting to other trails. Forests, beaches, prairies, and bluffs dominate the landscape of the park. Daybreak Star Cultural Center is within the park's boundaries. The West Point Lighthouse is located on West Point, the westernmost point of the park and the entire city of Seattle. On the south side of the North Beach strip is the West Point Treatment Plant which is almost entirely concealed from the marsh, beach, and trail.
