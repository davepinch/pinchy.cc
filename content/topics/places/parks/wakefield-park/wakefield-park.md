title: "Wakefield Park"
dave:
  - My parents brought me and my brothers sledding here one winter.
  - Once I biked around the neighborhood along both sides of the lake.
  - On mornings after the 4th of July, I would walk to the park with my brothers or friends to search for unused fire crackers.
  - I remember one year sitting in the car waiting to see the fireworks.
  - This park had an open drain I explored a few times with friends.
  - In one exploration I cut my foot from glass.
  - My friend John Shingler ripped his shirt off so I could use it wrap my foot.
  - I needed stitches.
  - Even today, there is a part of my toe I cannot feel.
  - Some years later I returned with my brother and friend to explore the old drain in the park. The drain was gated.
