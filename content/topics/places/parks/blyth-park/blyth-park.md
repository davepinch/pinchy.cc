TODO: Make sure Blyth Park is not marked as part of Snohomish County when automatically adding the park to parent "of" items. Normally items are added to parent "of" items recursively. In this case, Bothell has two parent counties (Snohomish County and King County). I want the park to limit to King County, so I explicitely add the desired parent item.
