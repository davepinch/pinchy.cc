Sherwood Park is a neighborhood park in [Maplewood](/maplewood/). The official address is 2237 Kennard Street, Maplewood, MN 55109. However, as a child I entered the park at a trail entrance near Lark and Hazelwood.

The park is very different from the 1980s. In the early 80's, there was a single large trail that went from Hazelwood/Lark to County Road B. From Hazelwood, the start of the trail was a wooded area that remains in part today. There was an small offshoot that lead to the pond. The main trail continued to a small field opening where the pond was visible. The trail continued into another wooded area before opening into large fields. In the early 80's there was large mounds of dirty that kids used as jumps for bikes. Those mounds were close to the souther perimiter of the park.
