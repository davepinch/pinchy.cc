  As a child I entered the park at a trail entrance near Lark and Hazelwood. The park is very different from the 1980s. In the early 80's, there was a single large trail that went from Hazelwood/Lark to County Road B. From Hazelwood, the start of the trail was a wooded area that remains in part today. There was an small offshoot to the pond. The main trail continued to a small break in the woods where the pond was visible. The trail then continued through another wooded area before opening into a large field. In the early 80's there were large mounds of dirt that kids used for bike jumps. These mounds were close to the southern perimiter of the park.
