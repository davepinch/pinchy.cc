excerpt: >-
  **Yerba Buena Gardens** is the name for two blocks of public parks located between Third and Fourth, Mission and Folsom Streets in downtown [San Francisco](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco/), [California](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California/). The first block bordered by Mission and Howard Streets was opened on October 11, 1993. The second block, between Howard and Folsom Streets, was opened in 1998, with a dedication to Martin Luther King Jr. by Mayor Willie Brown. A pedestrian bridge over Howard Street connects the two blocks, sitting on top of part of the Moscone Center convention center. The Yerba Buena Gardens were planned and built as the final centerpiece of the Yerba Buena Redevelopment Area which includes the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. Yerba Buena Gardens Conservancy operates, manages, programs, and elevates the property on behalf of the City and County of San Francisco.
