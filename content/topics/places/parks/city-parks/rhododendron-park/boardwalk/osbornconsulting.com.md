  The new fiberglass grated boardwalk involved several innovative features. Pin piles were used to support the boardwalk to minimize impacts to the wetland. The wetland area and site near the river has highly compressible soils up to 20 feet deep that could lead to settling of civil structures. To combat this structural concern, the team designed pin piles to provide the necessary stabilization while minimizing wetland impacts. It was imperative that the new boardwalk and paths were wide enough for people carrying rowing shells from the park’s south parking lot to the floating dock. The engineering team modeled the path a rowing shell would travel to ensure the route would be accessible for portaging hand-powered watercrafts.
