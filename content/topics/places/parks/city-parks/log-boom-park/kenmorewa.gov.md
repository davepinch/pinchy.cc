excerpt: >-
  This 3.9-acre park provides access to over 1200 lineal feet of shoreline on Kenmore's Lake Washington waterfront. The public dock is a fantastic place to watch the seaplanes land, toss out a line for fishing or simply enjoy the sunset. Other features include the Kenmore History Path, playground area, picnic tables, access to the Burke-Gilman Trail, daytime moorage, and restroom facility. The park was renamed Tracy Owen Station after the late King County Councilmember, Tracy Owen.
