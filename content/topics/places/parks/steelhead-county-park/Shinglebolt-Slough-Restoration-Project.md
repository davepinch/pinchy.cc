excerpt: >-
  The Shinglebolt Slough project is a mainstem, off-channel, riparian, and floodplain restoration project. The project is located along the Skykomish River mainstem and active floodplain. Several project alternatives will be evaluated – looking at existing flood and infrastructure conditions, modeled river hydrology, and predicted changes in river morphology – to determine ecological and flood benefits, as well as infrastructure resiliency needs.
