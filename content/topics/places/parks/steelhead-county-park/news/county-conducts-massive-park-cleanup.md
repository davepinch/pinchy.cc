excerpt: >-
  Snohomish County agencies spent Thursday and part of Friday last week engaged in a massive cleanup effort of the area known as Steelhead County Park, which is located just south of Sultan along the Skykomish River. Widely used by homeless and transient individuals as an illegal camping area, the total weight of the garbage removed from the wooded, riverside piece of property topped out at over 12 tons; roughly equivalent to that of a 38-foot, 84-passenger school bus.
