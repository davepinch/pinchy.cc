excerpt: >-
  Tracy Owen Station at Log Boom Park is a 3.9-acre park that provides access to over 1,200 lineal feet of shoreline on Kenmoreâ€™s Lake Washington waterfront. This shoreline was where early loggers once operated mills and anchored their log booms, clusters of floating logs enclosed within cables. Some of the old pilings from as early as 1902 are still visible. The current 600-foot-long public fishing pier was built over original pilings. The park also features a playground, restrooms, picnic tables, daytime moorage and access to the Burke Gilman Trail. Kayak and paddleboard rentals are available during the summertime.
