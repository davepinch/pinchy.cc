**Salt Creek Recreation Area** is a 196-acre park located about 15 miles west of [Port Angeles](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Angeles,_Washington), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)) on U.S. Route 101 near the city of Joyce, Washington. The park was previously Camp Hayden, a World War II military camp built 1942â€“1945. The site was established as the Striped Peak Military Reservation in 1941, renamed as Camp Hayden on 22 October 1942, and renamed again as Fort Hayden on 17 April 1944. It was named for Brigadier General John Louis Hayden, a former commander of the Harbor Defenses of Puget Sound. It was purchased by the Federal General Services Administration after the war. There are still several structures left from the fort, including two large casemates which sheltered 16" guns and several other structures. The 16-inch battery was Battery 131, with two ex-Navy 16-inch Mark 2 guns capable of firing a one-ton projectile around 28 miles connected by a large magazine bunker. The camp also had Battery 249, which had two 6-inch guns with a bunker housing magazines and fire control equipment.
