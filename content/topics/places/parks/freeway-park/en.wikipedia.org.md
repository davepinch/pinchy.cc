  **Freeway Park**, officially known as **Jim Ellis Freeway Park**, is an urban park in [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle/), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/), [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States/), connecting the city's downtown to the Washington State Convention Center and [First Hill](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Hill,_Seattle/). The park sits atop a section of [Interstate 5](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_5_in_Washington/) and a large city-owned parking lot; 8th Avenue also bridges over the park. An unusual mixture of brutalist architecture and greenery, the 5.2-acre (21,000 m2) park, designed by Lawrence Halprin's office under the supervision of Angela Danadjieva, opened to the public on July 4, 1976, at a cost of $23.5 million. A later addition to the park opened in 1982 winds several blocks up First Hill, with a staircase and wheelchair ramp.
