title: "Freeway Park Landmark Nomination (PDF)"
excerpt: >-
  Freeway Park is a five-acre urban park threading its way between Seattle’s commercial core and the First Hill neighborhood. In its original configuration, the park was 1300 feet long and of varying width, with some areas of the park less than 60 feet wide. Its primary massing sits atop two bridge spans, each covering over 400 feet of Interstate 5 (I-5), which runs in an excavated canyon through downtown Seattle (Marshall 399). This bridge contains “the 23 largest precast-concrete girders ever transported on [Washington’s] highways” up to the time of construction.
