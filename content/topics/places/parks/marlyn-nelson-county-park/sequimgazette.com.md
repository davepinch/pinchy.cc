excerpt: >-
  My dad passed away in 2013 and now I find myself taking these drives and picking a random spot. And since 2020 has been the year of drives, with one at times not being able to do anything else, I found myself back at Port Williams — or what’s now called Marlyn Wayne Nelson Memorial Park. [¶](/pilcrow/) The Clallam County park is described today as a beach for families, birdwatchers, dog lovers and beach walkers. But as I drove down the road that ends at the park, I wondered how many people knew about Port Williams, and did they know there had been an active port there at one time?
