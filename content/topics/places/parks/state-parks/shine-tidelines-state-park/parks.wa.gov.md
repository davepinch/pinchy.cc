  Located just off State Route 104, just north of the Hood Canal Bridge, this sandy shoreline is popular with kayakers, paddle boarders and beach walkers. This park also offers a small wetlands area for excellent local wildlife and birds viewing. Shellfish lovers will enjoy low tide harvesting during clam and oyster season, which make it a popular site for locals.
