  The **Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary** is a city park in the [Mississippi River](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River/) corridor in [Saint Paul](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Paul,_Minnesota/), [Minnesota](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota). Just east of the city's downtown district, the sanctuary includes towering limestone and sandstone bluffs that date back more than 450 million years, spring-fed wetlands, abundant bird life, and dramatic views of the downtown Saint Paul skyline and Mississippi River. The park was opened to the public on May 21, 2005, and was named after its early supporter U.S. Representative Bruce Vento.
