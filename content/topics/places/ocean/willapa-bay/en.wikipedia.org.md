  **Willapa Bay** (/ˈwɪləpɑː/) is a bay located on the southwest [Pacific coast](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean/) of [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/) state in the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States/). The Long Beach Peninsula separates Willapa Bay from the greater expanse of the Pacific Ocean. With over 120 square miles (310 km2) of surface area Willapa Bay is the second-largest riverine estuary on the Pacific coast of the continental United States. Early settlers called the bay **Shoalwater Bay** and this name is found on old maps and charts of the region.
