  The **Río de la Plata** (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈri.o ðe la ˈplata]; lit. 'River of Silver'), also called the **River Plate** or **La Plata River** in English, is the estuary formed by the confluence of the Uruguay River and the Paraná River at Punta Gorda. It empties into the [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean/) and forms a funnel-shaped indentation on the southeastern coastline of [South America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America/). Depending on the geographer, the Río de la Plata may be considered a river, an estuary, a gulf, or a marginal sea. If considered a river, it is the widest in the world, with a maximum width of 220 kilometres (140 mi).
