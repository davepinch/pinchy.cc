excerpt: >-
  The **Atlantic Ocean** is the second-largest of the world's five oceans, with an area of about 106,460,000 km2 (41,100,000 sq mi). It covers approximately 20% of Earth's surface and about 29% of its water surface area. It is known to separate the "Old World" of Africa, [Europe](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe/), and [Asia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia/) from the "New World" of the Americas in the European perception of the World.
