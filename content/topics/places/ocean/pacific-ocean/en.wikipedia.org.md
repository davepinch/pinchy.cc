  The **Pacific Ocean** is the largest and deepest of [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/)'s five oceanic divisions. It extends from the [Arctic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Ocean/) in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south, and is bounded by the continents of [Asia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia/) and Oceania in the west and the Americas in the east.
