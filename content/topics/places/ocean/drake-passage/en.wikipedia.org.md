  The **Drake Passage** is the body of water between South America's Cape Horn, [Chile](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile/), [Argentina](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina/), and the South Shetland Islands of Antarctica. It connects the southwestern part of the Atlantic Ocean (Scotia Sea) with the southeastern part of the Pacific Ocean and extends into the Southern Ocean. The passage is named after the 16th-century English explorer and privateer Sir Francis Drake.
