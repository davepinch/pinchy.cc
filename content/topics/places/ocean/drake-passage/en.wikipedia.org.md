  The **Drake Passage** is the body of water between [South America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America/)'s Cape Horn, [Chile](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile/), [Argentina](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina/), and the South Shetland Islands of [Antarctica](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica/). It connects the southwestern part of the [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean/) (Scotia Sea) with the southeastern part of the [Pacific Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean/) and extends into the Southern Ocean. The passage is named after the 16th-century English explorer and privateer Sir Francis Drake.
