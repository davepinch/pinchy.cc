title: "Lime Kiln Trail"
dave: >-
  I had seen references to this trail for a while and wanted to visit. There is an old lime kiln somewhere along the trail. In July 2024, Mary and I visited and hiked about a mile from the trailhead before we had to leave (kiln not found). We will return in the future.
