title: "Denny Creek Trail 1014 (fs.usda.gov)"
excerpt: >-
  Start hiking in an old-growth forest, cross a bridge over Denny Creek, pass under the I-90 westbound bridge and enter the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. In a mile you'll hike back across Denny Creek, but without a bridge. Be prepared to turn around here during high water from spring snowmelt.  Later in the year large slabs of exposed bedrock next to Denny Creek make this a popular picnic site.
