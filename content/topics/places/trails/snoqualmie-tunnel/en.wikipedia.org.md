  The **Snoqualmie Tunnel** is a former railroad tunnel near [Snoqualmie Pass](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoqualmie_Pass/) in the U.S. state of [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)), located east of [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle). The tunnel crosses the [Cascade Range](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Range/) about three miles (5 km) south of the pass, which is used by [Interstate 90](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_90/), on the border between [King County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_County,_Washington) and [Kittitas County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kittitas_County,_Washington). It is 11,894 feet (2.253 mi; 3.625 km) long and is at an approximate elevation of 2,600 feet (790 m) above sea level, just north of [Keechelus Lake](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keechelus_Lake).
