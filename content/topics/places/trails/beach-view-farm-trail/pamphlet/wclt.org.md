excerpt: >-
   This 315-acre farm is one of the few remaining large working farms on Whidbey Island. For more than 150 years, this farm has served a variety of agricultural purposes. Expansive views of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Olympics made it attractive for development. Fortunately, the farm’s owners sold a conservation easement to the Land Trust, ensuring permanent protection of this treasured farm and forest.
