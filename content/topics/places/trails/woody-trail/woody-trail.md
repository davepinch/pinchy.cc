title: "Woody Trail"
description: >-
  The Woody Trail is the main hiking trail of Wallace Falls State Park. It is connected to a larger trail named *Railroad Grade* (not to be confused with the trail of the same name that reaches Mount Baker). The trailhead is next to the parking lot of the park. It first runs along under transmission lines, and then enters the forest and runs along the Wallace River. The primary destinations are the famous waterfalls of the park.
