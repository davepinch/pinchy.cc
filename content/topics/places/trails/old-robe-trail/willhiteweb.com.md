excerpt: >-
  If you are at all fascinated by the history of the Monte Cristo area, you need to see the tunnels of the Monte Cristo Railroad near Granite Falls. The railroad tunnels were constructed in 1892 as part of the rail line between Everett and Monte Cristo. In Robe Canyon, they constructed three bridges and six tunnels. Shortly after, a storm washed out the grade and buried parts of it in landslides. The river would even travel through the tunnels washing everything away. After this happened a few times, they decided to embed the rail ties in concrete, including through tunnel #6.
