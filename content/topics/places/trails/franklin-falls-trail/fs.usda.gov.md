excerpt: >-
  A favorite hike for families, the Franklin Falls Trail follows the south fork of the Snoqualmie River for a mile, skirting a canyon with glimpses of deep pools and cascades in the river below as it descends the upper South Fork Valley below Snoqualmie Pass. The descent to the base of the 70-foot falls is steep and slippery but plenty of visitors make it down to eat lunch or cool in the mist of the plunge pool. It is an easy walk that rises gradually through old growth forests with views of the river. The trail ends at the base of Franklin Falls.
