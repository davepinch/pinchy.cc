title: "Saddle Mountains"
note: This is a ridge, not a mountain or mountain range. It is commonly written in singular and plural. However, it should not be confused with a little-known Saddle Mountain in Mason County near the Olympic mountains. In the majority of cases online, when you see Saddle Mountain(s) in Washington, it is referring to the ridge in Grant County, central Washington, near the Columbia River.
