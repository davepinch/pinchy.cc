excerpt: >-
  The **Indian Ocean** is the third-largest of the world's five oceanic divisions, covering 70,560,000 km2 (27,240,000 sq mi) or approx. 20% of the water on [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/)'s surface. It is bounded by [Asia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia/) to the north, [Africa](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa/) to the west and [Australia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_(continent)/) to the east. To the south it is bounded by the Southern Ocean, or [Antarctica](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica/), depending on the definition in use. Along its core, the Indian Ocean has large marginal, or regional seas, such as the Andaman Sea, the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the Laccadive Sea.
