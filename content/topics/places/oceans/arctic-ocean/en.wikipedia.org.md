  The **Arctic Ocean** is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. It spans an area of approximately 14,060,000 km2 (5,430,000 sq mi) and is known as one of the coldest of oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea. It has also been described as an estuary of the [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean/). It is also seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean.
