excerpt: >-
  **Panthalassa**, also known as the **Panthalassic Ocean** or **Panthalassan Ocean** (from Greek πᾶν "all" and θάλασσα "sea"), was the superocean that surrounded the supercontinent [Pangaea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea/), the latest in a series of supercontinents in the history of [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/). During the Paleozoic–Mesozoic transition c. 250 Ma it occupied almost 70% of Earth's surface. Its ocean floor has completely disappeared because of the continuous subduction along the continental margins on its circumference. Panthalassa is also referred to as the **Paleo-Pacific** ("old Pacific") or **Proto-Pacific** because the [Pacific Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean/) is a direct continuation of Panthalassa.
