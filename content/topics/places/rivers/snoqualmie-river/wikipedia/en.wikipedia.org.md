  The **Snoqualmie River** is a 45-mile (72 km) long river in [King County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_County,_Washington/) and [Snohomish County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snohomish_County,_Washington/) in the U.S. state of [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/). The river's three main tributaries are the North, Middle, and South Forks, which drain the west side of the [Cascade Mountains](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Range/) near the town of [North Bend](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Bend,_Washington/) and join near the town of Snoqualmie just above the Snoqualmie Falls. After the falls the river flows north through rich farmland and the towns of Fall City, Carnation, and Duvall before meeting the [Skykomish River](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skykomish_River/) to form the [Snohomish River](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snohomish_River/) near [Monroe](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe,_Washington/). The Snohomish River empties into [Puget Sound](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound/) at [Everett](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett,_Washington/). Other tributaries of the Snoqualmie River include the Taylor River and the Pratt River, both of which enter the Middle Fork, the Tolt River, which joins at Carnation, and the Raging River at Fall City.
