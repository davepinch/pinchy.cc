excerpt: >-
  The **Lummi River** is the current name for a river channel that was, prior to the beginning of the 20th century, the main outflow channel for the Nooksack River. It then emptied into Lummi Bay rather than Bellingham Bay, as the current channel of the Nooksack River does. At the time, the channel that now serves as the main channel of the Nooksack River was restricted by a massive, mile-long, log jam. This was the result of the timber industry floating logs downriver to ports for processing and shipping.
