excerpt: >-
  The **Skykomish River** is a 29-mile (47 km) long river in the U.S. state of [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/) which drains the west side of the [Cascade Mountains](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Range/) in the southeast section of [Snohomish County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snohomish_County,_Washington/) and the northeast corner of [King County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_County,_Washington/). The river starts with the confluence of the North Fork Skykomish River and South Fork Skykomish River approximately one mile west of Index, then flowing northwesterly towards [Puget Sound](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound/). It is joined by the Sultan River and the Wallace River at [Sultan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan,_Washington/). It then meets the Snoqualmie River to form the Snohomish River at [Monroe](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe,_Washington/). The Snohomish River continues along the river valley eventually dumping into Port Gardner Bay on Possession Sound (part of Puget Sound).
