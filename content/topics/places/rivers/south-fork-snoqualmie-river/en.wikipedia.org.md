excerpt: >-
  The South Fork, approximately 31 miles (50 km) long, begins at the outlet of tiny Source Lake, 47°27′18″N 121°27′9″W, and flows southeast before soon turning southwest and continuing to flow in that direction until after Denny Creek joins. It then flows west for a bit before turning northwest and continuing in that general direction until it merges with the Snoqualmie River Proper just above Snoqualmie Falls. It drops over a total of 6 waterfalls (many would argue 8 because many people divide the final one into three portions).
