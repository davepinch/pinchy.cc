      The river is the result of geologic forces going back 1.1 billion years. At that time, the Mid-Continent Rift rendered the middle of North America apart, creating a volcanic zone. The lava spewed forth cooled into hard basalt. That basalt is what today creates the dramatic cliffs around the Interstate State Parks.

      About 500 million years ago, a shallow sea covered the area, laying down layers of sand and minerals that make up much of the sandstone bluffs now seen along the river.

The **St. Croix River** (/ˈseɪnt ˈkrɔɪ/ SAYNT KROY; literally "holy cross" in French) is a tributary of the [Mississippi River](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River), approximately 169 miles (272 km) long, in the U.S. states of [Wisconsin](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin) and [Minnesota](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota). The lower 125 miles (201 km) of the river form the border between Wisconsin and Minnesota. The river is a National Scenic Riverway under the protection of the National Park Service. A hydroelectric plant at the Saint Croix Falls Dam supplies power to the Minneapolis–St. Paul metropolitan area.
