excerpt: >-
  The **Methow River** (/ˈmɛthaʊ/ MET-how) is a tributary of the [Columbia River](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_River/) in northern [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/) in the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States/). The river's 1,890-square-mile (4,900 km2) watershed drains the eastern North Cascades, with a population of about 5,000 people. The Methow's watershed is characterized by relatively pristine habitats, as much of the river basin is located in national forests and wildernesses. Many tributaries drain the large Pasayten Wilderness. An earlier economy based on agriculture is giving way to one based on recreation and tourism.
