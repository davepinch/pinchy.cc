  The **Urubamba River** or **Vilcamayo River** (possibly from Quechua Willkamayu, for "sacred river") is a river in Peru. Upstream it is called **Vilcanota River** (possibly from Aymara Willkanuta, for "house of the sun"). Within the La Convenci√≥n Province, the name changes to Urubamba. A partially navigable headwater of the Amazon River, the Urubamba rises in the Andes to the southeast of Cusco. It originates on the slopes of Cunurana in the Puno Region, Melgar Province, near the La Raya pass. It flows north-north-west for 724 km (450 mi) before coalescing with the Tambo River to form the Ucayali River.
