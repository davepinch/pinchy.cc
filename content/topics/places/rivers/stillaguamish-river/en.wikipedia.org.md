  The **Stillaguamish River** is a river in the northwestern region of the U.S. state of [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/). It is mainly composed of two forks, the longer **North Fork Stillaguamish** (45 miles (72 km)) and the **South Fork Stillaguamish**. The two forks join near [Arlington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Washington/). From there the Stillaguamish River proper flows for 22 miles (35 km) to [Puget Sound](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound/). The river's watershed drains part of the [Cascade Range](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Range/) north of [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle/).
