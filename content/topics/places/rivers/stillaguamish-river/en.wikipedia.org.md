> The **Stillaguamish River** is a river in the northwestern region of the U.S. state of [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)). It is mainly composed of two forks, the longer **North Fork Stillaguamish** (45 miles (72 km)) and the **South Fork Stillaguamish**. The two forks join near Arlington. From there the Stillaguamish River proper flows for 22 miles (35 km) to Puget Sound. The river's watershed drains part of the Cascade Range north of [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle).
