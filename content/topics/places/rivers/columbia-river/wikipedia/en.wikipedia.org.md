  The **Columbia River** (Upper Chinook: *Wimahl* or *Wimal*; Sahaptin: *Nch’i-Wàna* or *Nchi wana*; Sinixt dialect *swah'netk'qhu*) is the largest river in the [Pacific Northwest](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest/) region of [North America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America/). The river forms in the Rocky Mountains of [British Columbia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia/), [Canada](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada/). It flows northwest and then south into the U.S. state of [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/), then turns west to form most of the border between Washington and the state of [Oregon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon/) before emptying into the [Pacific Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean/). The river is 1,243 miles (2,000 kilometers) long, and its largest tributary is the Snake River. Its drainage basin is roughly the size of [France](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France/) and extends into seven states of the United States and one Canadian province. The fourth-largest river in the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States/) by volume, the Columbia has the greatest flow of any North American river entering the Pacific. The Columbia has the 36th greatest discharge of any river in the world.
