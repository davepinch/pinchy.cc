excerpt: >-
  The **Snohomish River** is a river in [Snohomish County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snohomish_County,_Washington/), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/), formed by the confluence of the [Skykomish](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skykomish_River/) and [Snoqualmie rivers](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoqualmie_River/) near [Monroe](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe,_Washington/). It flows northwest entering Port Gardner Bay, part of [Puget Sound](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound/), between Everett and Marysville. The Pilchuck River is its main tributary and joins the river at Snohomish. The river system drains the west side of the [Cascade Mountains](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Range/) from [Snoqualmie Pass](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoqualmie_Pass/) to north of Stevens Pass.
