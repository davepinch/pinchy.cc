excerpt: >-
  The Middle Fork, approximately 41 miles (66 km) long, originates from Chain Lakes, 47°33′30″N 121°14′15″W, and flows south to Williams Lake, then in a westerly direction until it meets with the North Fork near North Bend. It receives the waters of the Taylor River and the Pratt River in short order about halfway between its source and its mouth. It has one major waterfall along its course. The upper reaches of the Middle Fork, Taylor, and Pratt river valleys are within the boundaries of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.
