excerpt: >-
  The **Mississippi River** is the second-longest river and chief river of the second-largest drainage system in [North America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America/), second only to the Hudson Bay drainage system. From its traditional source of [Lake Itasca](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Itasca/) in northern Minnesota, it flows generally south for 2,340 miles (3,766 km) to the Mississippi River Delta in the [Gulf of Mexico](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico). With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 32 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains. The main stem is entirely within the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States/); the total drainage basin is 1,151,000 sq mi (2,980,000 km2), of which only about one percent is in [Canada](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada/). The Mississippi ranks as the thirteenth-largest river by discharge in the world. The river either borders or passes through the states of [Minnesota](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota/), [Wisconsin](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin/), [Iowa](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa/), [Illinois](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois/), [Missouri](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri/), [Kentucky](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky/), [Tennessee](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee/), [Arkansas](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas/), [Mississippi](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi/), and [Louisiana](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana/).
