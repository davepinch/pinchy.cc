excerpt: >-
  The Skagit Bay Estuary Unit is comprised of estuary and intertidal area. This unit is primarily accessible by boat; there is some local area walk-in access during low tides. There are six locations offering access to this unit: WDFW Skagit Headquarters Unit (has a boat ramp); Big Ditch and Davis Slough (hand-launch boat access); Jensen; Milltown; and North Fork. Tides and river levels may restrict access. Recreation opportunities on the unit include waterfowl hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, hiking, boating and kayaking. The Skagit estuary contains critical habitats for waterfowl, shorebirds, fish and other aquatic species.
