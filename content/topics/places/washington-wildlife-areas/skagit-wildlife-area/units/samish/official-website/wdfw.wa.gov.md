excerpt: >-
  The Samish Unit is comprised of agricultural fields and wetlands, located adjacent to Padilla Bay in northwest Skagit County. This is a popular waterfowl hunting and wildlife watching site planted with barley, corn, and fava beans to enhance food resources for wintering waterfowl and provide hunting opportunity. During the winter months, evening waterfowl feeding flights can be quite impressive. Past and current wetland enhancement projects have improved water management and wetland function.
