excerpt: >-
  The South Padilla Bay Unit of the Skagit Wildlife Area consists of 278 acres of mostly agricultural land at the south end of Padilla Bay in Skagit County. The four parcels that make up the unit are leased to local area farmers who produce cash crops in the summer and plant cover crops in the fall for migratory waterfowl forage. On two of the parcels, the lessee is required to plant and leave unharvested crops (typically barley) for high-value waterfowl forage. These same two parcels support three waterfowl hunting blinds managed by WDFWâ€™s Private Lands Access Program. Due to safety concerns and to reduce disturbance to foraging waterfowl, hunting on the unit is limited to these three blinds.
