excerpt: >-
  The Samish River Unit covers 107 acres in northwest Skagit County. The unit was comprised of agricultural land until WDFW acquired it in 2004. The federal Natural Resource Conservation Service holds an easement on the property which allows for 15 acres to be managed with agricultural enhancements for migratory waterfowl forage. The remainder of the unit is a mix of sculpted wetlands, grass fields, and shrub-scrub habitat. Two waterfowl hunting areas on the unit are managed by WDFW's Private Lands Access Program.
