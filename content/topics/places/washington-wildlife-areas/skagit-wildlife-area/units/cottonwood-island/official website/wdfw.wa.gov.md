excerpt: >-
  The Cottonwood Island Unit is a unique forested property that is representative of a historic habitat type that would have been more widespread along the lower Skagit River Valley. It provides valuable mature cottonwood forest habitat for a variety of forest birds and raptors, primarily buteos and eagles. The remnant of Cottonwood Slough also provides off-channel habitat for salmonids during certain times of the year and has been evaluated for potential habitat restoration projects.
