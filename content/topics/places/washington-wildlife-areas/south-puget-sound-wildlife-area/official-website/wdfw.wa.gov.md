excerpt: >-
  The South Puget Sound Wildlife Area covers 5,790 acres spread across Mason, Kitsap, Pierce, and Thurston counties in eight units. Major rivers and tributaries flow into Puget Sound, Hood Canal, or the Chehalis River, which flows out into Grays Harbor. The wildlife area supports many prairie, estuary, and wetland dependent species, as well as a variety of other wildlife and native fish populations, some of which are federally endangered. Each unit provides habitat for many common species found throughout western Washington, such as deer, elk, river otter, hawks, and a many different song birds. In addition to common species, units are managed either for recreation associated with fish and wildlife or for the protection of specific species and their habitats.
