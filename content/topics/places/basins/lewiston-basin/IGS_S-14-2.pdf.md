excerpt: >-
  Lewiston, Idaho, and Clarkston, Washington, are at the confluence of the Snake and Clearwater rivers in the Lewiston basin. Hells Canyon stretches to the south of Lewiston on the Snake River. This is the lowest point in Idaho at 720 feet (220 m) elevation. Lewiston is Idahoâ€™s seaport, a result of slack water created by several dams and locks on the Columbia- Snake River system.
