  In biogeography, the **Mediterranean Basin** (/ˌmɛdɪtəˈreɪniən/ MED-ih-tə-RAY-nee-ən), also known as the **Mediterranean Region** or sometimes **Mediterranea**, is the region of lands around the [Mediterranean Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea/) that have mostly a Mediterranean climate, with mild to cool, rainy winters and warm to hot, dry summers, which supports characteristic Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub vegetation. It was a very important part of Mediterranean civilizations.
