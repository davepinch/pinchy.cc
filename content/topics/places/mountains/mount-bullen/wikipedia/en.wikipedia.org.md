excerpt: >-
  **Mount Bullen** is a 5,978-foot-elevation (1,822 m) mountain summit located at the western edge of the North Cascades, in Snohomish County of Washington state. It is situated 20 mi (32 km) east of the community of Arlington, Washington, in the Boulder River Wilderness, on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Nearby neighbors include line parent Whitehorse Mountain, 1.44 mi (2.32 km) to the northeast and Three Fingers, 1.84 mi (2.96 km) to the south. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into headwaters of the Boulder River. Topographic relief is significant as the southeast aspect rises 2,000 feet (610 meters) above Bullen Lake in approximately one-half mile, and the west aspect rises 4,200 feet (1,300 meters) above Boulder River in two miles.
