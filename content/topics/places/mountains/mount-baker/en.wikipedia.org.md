  **Mount Baker** (Lummi: *Qwú’mə Kwəlshé*ːn; Nooksack: *Kw’eq Smaenit* or *Kwelshán*), also known as **Koma Kulshan** or simply **Kulshan**, is a 10,781 ft (3,286 m) active glacier-covered andesitic stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc and the North Cascades of [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)) in the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). Mount Baker has the second-most thermally active crater in the Cascade Range after Mount St. Helens. About 30 miles (48 km) due east of the city of [Bellingham](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellingham,_Washington), [Whatcom County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whatcom_County,_Washington), Mount Baker is the youngest volcano in the Mount Baker volcanic field. While volcanism has persisted here for some 1.5 million years, the current volcanic cone is likely no more than 140,000 years old, and possibly no older than 80–90,000 years. Older volcanic edifices have mostly eroded away due to glaciation.
