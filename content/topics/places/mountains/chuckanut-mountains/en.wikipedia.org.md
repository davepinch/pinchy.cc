excerpt: >-
  The **Chuckanut Mountains** (from "Chuckanut", an indigenous word meaning "long beach far from a narrow entrance"), or Chuckanuts, are located on the northern [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/) state coast of the [Salish Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salish_Sea/), just south of [Bellingham](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellingham,_Washington), Washington. Being a part of the [Cascade Range](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Range/), they are the only place where the Cascades come west down to meet the sea. The Chuckanuts are considered to be a part of the Puget Lowland Forest Ecoregion.
