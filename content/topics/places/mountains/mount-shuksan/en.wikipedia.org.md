  **Mount Shuksan** is a glaciated massif in the North Cascades National Park. Shuksan rises in [Whatcom County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whatcom_County,_Washington/), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/) immediately to the east of [Mount Baker](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Baker/), and 11.6 miles (18.7 km) south of the Canada–US border. The mountain's name *Shuksan* is derived from the Lummi word [šéqsən], said to mean "high peak". The highest point on the mountain is a three-sided peak known as Summit Pyramid.
