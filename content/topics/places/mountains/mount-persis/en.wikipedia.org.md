  **Mount Persis** is a 5,464 ft summit located in [Snohomish County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snohomish_County,_Washington/), of [Washington]([Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state))) state. The mountain is part of the [Cascade Range](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Range/) and is situated in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The mountain was named for Persis Gunn, the wife of homesteader/miner Amos Gunn who started the nearby town of [Index, Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index,_Washington/), and also named nearby Mount Index. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the [Skykomish River](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skykomish_River/). The rocks of Mount Persis are volcanic in origin and are considered amongst some of the earliest expressions of volcanism in the Cascade Mountain range in Washington.
