climbing of: Denny Mountain
excerpt: >-
  Denny Mountain is the prominent peak seen to the northwest of Snoqualmie Pass and to the north of I-90. The mountain consists of a one-mile long ridgeline oriented to the NNW with many jagged outcrops. The southern buttress of Denny can be seen towering above I-90 as the road approaches the pass from the west but the actual highpoint of the summit is hidden from eastbound freeway vantage points. The summit can be spotted by westbound drivers from the pass. Its NE face is home to the notoriously challenging Alpental ski area that boasts of having only 3% "easy" slopes and 75% "expert" with 22% in between.
