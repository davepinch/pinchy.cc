  **Squak Mountain** is the second most westerly mountain of the [Issaquah Alps](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issaquah_Alps/) mountain chain in Washington state. It is situated between Cougar Mountain to the west and Tiger Mountain to the east. [Interstate 90](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_90/) parallels the base of the north side of the mountain. Much of the Squak Mountain watershed drains into [Lake Sammamish](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Sammamish/). Most of the mountain is protected by **Squak Mountain State Park** and the Cougar/Squak and Squak/Tiger Corridors of King County.
