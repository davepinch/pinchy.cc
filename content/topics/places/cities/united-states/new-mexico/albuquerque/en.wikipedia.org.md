  **Albuquerque** (/ˈælbəˌkɜːrki/ *AL-bə-kur-kee*; Spanish: [alβuˈkeɾke]), abbreviated **ABQ**, is the most populous city in the U.S. state of [New Mexico](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico/). Its nicknames, **The Duke City** and **Burque**, both reference its founding in 1706 as La Villa de Alburquerque by Nuevo México governor Francisco Cuervo y Valdés. Named in honor of the Viceroy of New Spain, the 10th Duke of Alburquerque, the city was an outpost on El Camino Real linking Mexico City to the northernmost territories of New Spain. In 2006 the city celebrated its 300th anniversary.
