  [Michael] King built many small buildings and shacks along the shore for his men and animals. In 1882, he was done and moved on. The shacks and bunkhouses were left behind and lived in by drifters, squatters and old loggers. People living in the area often referred to this as "King's Town", probably as a joke. The name slowly evolved into Kingston and stuck.
