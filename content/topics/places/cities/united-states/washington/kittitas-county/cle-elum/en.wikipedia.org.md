excerpt: >-
  **Cle Elum** (/kli ˈɛləm/ *klee ELL-um*) is a city in [Kittitas County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kittitas_County,_Washington), [Washington]([Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state))), [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). The population was 1,872 at the 2010 census. About 84 miles (135 km) by car from [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle), Cle Elum is a popular area for camping and outdoor activities. It is also unofficially considered the starting point of Eastern Washington when driving east on [I-90](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_90) from Seattle, although this is somewhat arbitrary since many consider either the town of Easton, anywhere east of [Keechelus Lake](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keechelus_Lake), or the wildlife crossing bridge over I-90 to be the starting point.
