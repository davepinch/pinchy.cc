excerpt: >-
  The City of Shoreline is one of Seattle’s closest suburbs. Located immediately north of Seattle's city limits, the area was settled first by homesteaders and soon after by vacationers. Over time a community formed, and although Seattle’s boundaries have pushed farther north, Shoreline has preserved its autonomy and, in the 1990s, incorporated as a city in its own right.
