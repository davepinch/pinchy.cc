description: "Map of major Seattle, Washington roads, 1929. The title of this map—“Stop Before Entering”—originated with the city’s directive to drivers, urging them to be cautious while driving and to have their vehicles come to a complete stop at intersections before turning or joining traffic flow via one of these routes."
