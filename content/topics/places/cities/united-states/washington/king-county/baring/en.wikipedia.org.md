excerpt: >-
  **Baring** is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in King County, Washington, United States. The population was 255 at the 2020 census, up from 220 at the 2010 census. It is located on U.S. Highway 2 about 23 miles (37 km) west of Stevens Pass, along a very flat and straight three-mile section of highway that has been dubbed the "Baring Straight" (a play on the Bering Strait between Alaska and Russia), since US-2 is otherwise hilly and curvy through the mountains. The settlement was first known as "Salmon", but by 1909 it was known as Baring.
