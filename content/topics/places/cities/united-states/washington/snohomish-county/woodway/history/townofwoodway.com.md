excerpt: >-
  Mr. David Whitcomb, Sr. planned the development of Woodway Park as a place for homes in a wooded country setting. In 1912 Mr. Whitcomb purchased the land between Richmond Beach and Edmonds, consisting of 320 acres stretching about a mile along Puget Sound and extending about a half-mile east. He added fractional lots along the tidelands and uplands, bringing the total to 400 acres. At the time of the purchase there was one structure, known as the Brown Owl Tavern, which is now a private residence on the west side of Woodway Park Road just north of the Deer Creek Bridge.
