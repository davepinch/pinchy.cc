title: "Coveland, Washington"
note: This community was listed on an 1867 nautical chart and has a small Wikipedia article, but it is not listed on OpenStreetMap. Yelp has a 10 best things to do in Coveland, but all of the things are hours away in Seattle (clearly Yelp auto-generates useless slop to get search engine hits).
