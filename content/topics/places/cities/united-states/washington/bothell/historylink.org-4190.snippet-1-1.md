excerpt: >-
  Loggers founded the King County community that became Bothell in the 1880s. After the trees were cut, Bothell became a farm community on the highway between Seattle and Everett. After World War II, the community grew into a suburb as homes took over the farms and dairy pastures. Between 1950 and 1992, the city expanded and the population multiplied 25 times. By the end of the twentieth century, Bothell reached out of King County and had become the third largest employment center in Snohomish County.
