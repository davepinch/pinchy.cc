excerpt: >-
  **Saint Paul** (often abbreviated **St. Paul**) is the capital of the U.S. state of [Minnesota](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota/) and the county seat of [Ramsey County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_County,_Minnesota/). Situated on high bluffs overlooking a bend in the [Mississippi River](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River/), Saint Paul is a regional business hub and the center of Minnesota's government. The Minnesota State Capitol and the state government offices all sit on a hill close to the city's downtown district. One of the oldest cities in Minnesota, Saint Paul has several historic neighborhoods and landmarks, such as the Summit Avenue Neighborhood, the James J. Hill House, and the Cathedral of Saint Paul. Like the adjacent city of [Minneapolis](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis/), Saint Paul is known for its cold, snowy winters and humid summers.
