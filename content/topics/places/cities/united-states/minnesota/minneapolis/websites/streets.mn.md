title: "The Minneapolis Street Grid: Explained (streets.mn)"
excerpt: >-
  When I moved to Minneapolis from upstate New York last year, I found myself puzzled by the layout of the streets and avenues across the city. Why, for example, did every street and avenue in my neighborhood have Southeast (SE) as a suffix? And why did that change to South (S) when I went to neighborhoods like Seward and Whittier? These questions lingered in my mind while wandering the city by bike, bus and light rail. I tried to find the origin of the northâ€“south divide and the east/not-east divide, as well as the underlying structure of the streets and avenues.
