excerpt: >-
  **Mendota** (/mɛnˈdoʊtə/ men-DOH-tə) is a city in [Dakota County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_County,_Minnesota/), [Minnesota](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota/), [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States/). The name is a mispronunciation of the Dakota word for the location, bdóte, which in Dakota tradition is the center of the world. The word in this use means "the confluence of the [Minnesota](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_River/) and [Mississippi](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River/) Rivers," and generally "mouth or junction of one river with another." The population was 198 at the 2010 census.
