excerpt: >-
  **Minneapolis–Saint Paul** is a metropolitan area in the Upper Midwestern United States centered around the confluence of the [Mississippi](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River/), Minnesota and [St. Croix](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Croix_River_(Wisconsin–Minnesota)/) rivers in the U.S. state of Minnesota. It is commonly known as the **Twin Cities** after the area's two largest cities, [Minneapolis](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis/) and [Saint Paul](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Paul,_Minnesota/). Minnesotans often refer to the two together (or the seven-county metro area collectively) simply as "the cities". The area is Minnesota's economic, cultural, and political center.
