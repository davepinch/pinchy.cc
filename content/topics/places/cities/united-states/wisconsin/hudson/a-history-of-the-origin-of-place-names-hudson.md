  Hudson, St. Croix County, Wisconsin. This place was called Buena Vista from the Mexican battlefield; earlier it was called Willow River from the river that runs into the St. Croix at this place. In 1852, the county board of Supervisors gave it its present name from the City of Hudson, New York; that was named for Henry Hudson, the navigator, who also gave his name to the river on which the City of Hudson, New York is located.

  Stillwater, Washington County, Minnesota, was located in 1838 and named in 1842 by John McKasick, because, owing to the great depth of the waters in the river (St. Croix), and from the fact that the fall in the water until it reaches the Mississippi River, is very slight, the waters ran very still. At an early day the town was called Dakotah from the Dakota (Sioux) Indian tribe.
