RESIDENCE OF JOHN PINCH, NEAR EPWORTH BURNED TO THE GROUND

Epworth, Ia., April 3.-The farm residence owned by John Pinch about six miles southwest of here was completely destroyed by fire one day this week. When the fire was discovered by members of the family who were in the house, the roof of the building was a mass of flames, and it was readily seen that the fire had progressed to a stage where it was impossible to save the building. There were no means of fighting the fire outside of a bucket brigade, and this was useless. The members of the family and neighbors who arrived in the scene set to work to save the household goods, but only a few things from the ground floor were removed. The loss was quite a severe one to Mr. Pinch and family and their friends regret to hear of their misfortune. The property was insured in the Farmer's Mutual Insurance Co. It's thought the fire originated from the chimney.
