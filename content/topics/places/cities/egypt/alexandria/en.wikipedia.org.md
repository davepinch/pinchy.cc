  **Alexandria** (/ˌælɪɡˈzændriə, -ˈzɑːn-/ *AL-ig-ZA(H)N-dree-ə*; Arabic: الإسكندرية; Greek: Ἀλεξάνδρεια, Coptic: Ⲣⲁⲕⲟϯ - Rakoti or ⲁⲗⲉⲝⲁⲛⲇⲣⲓⲁ) is the second largest city in [Egypt](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt/) and the largest city on the Mediterranean coast. It lies at the western edge of the Nile River delta. Founded in c. 331 BC by [Alexander the Great](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great/), Alexandria grew rapidly and became a major centre of Hellenic civilisation, eventually replacing Memphis, in present-day Greater Cairo, as Egypt's capital. Called the "Bride of the Mediterranean" internationally, Alexandria is a popular tourist destination and an important industrial centre due to its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez.
