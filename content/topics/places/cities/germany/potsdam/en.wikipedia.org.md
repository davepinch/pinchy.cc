  **Potsdam** (German pronunciation: [ˈpɔtsdam]) is the capital and, with around 183,000 inhabitants, largest city of the [German](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany/) state of Brandenburg. It is part of the Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region. Potsdam sits on the River Havel, a tributary of the Elbe, downstream of [Berlin](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin/), and lies embedded in a hilly morainic landscape dotted with many lakes, around 20 of which are located within Potsdam's city limits. It lies some 25 kilometres (16 miles) southwest of Berlin's city centre. The name of the city and of many of its boroughs are of Slavic origin.
