title: "Drove through Dhiban in October 2002"
dave: >-
  In 2002 I rented a car and drove from Amman, Jordan to Petra over the course of several days. One day I left Madaba on my way to Karak with Dhiban along the day; I picked up a police officer who was hitchhiking. This was fortunate, for not only was he good company, he helped me cross a very steep and massive canyon. I dropped him off near Karak.
visit of: Dhiban, Jordan
when: 2002-10
