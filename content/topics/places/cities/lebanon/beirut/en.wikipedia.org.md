  **Beirut** is the capital and largest city of [Lebanon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon). As of 2014, Greater Beirut has a population of 2.5 million, which makes it the third-largest city in the Levant region. The city is situated on a peninsula at the midpoint of Lebanon's [Mediterranean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea/) coast. Beirut has been inhabited for more than 5,000 years, and was one of Phoenicia's most prominent city states, making it one of the oldest cities in the world (see Berytus). The first historical mention of Beirut is found in the Amarna letters from the New Kingdom of Egypt, which date to the 14th century BC.
