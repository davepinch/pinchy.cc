  **Nazareth** (/ˈnæzərəθ/ NAZ-ər-əth; Arabic: النَّاصِرَة‎, romanized: an-Nāṣira; Hebrew: נָצְרַת‎, romanized: Nāṣəraṯ; Syriac: ܢܨܪܬ, romanized: Naṣrath) is the largest city in the Northern District of Israel. In 2022 its population was 78,007. Known as "the Arab capital of Israel", Nazareth serves as a cultural, political, religious, economic and commercial center for the Arab citizens of [Israel](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel/), as well as a center of Arab and Palestinian nationalism. The inhabitants are predominantly Arab citizens of Israel, of whom 69% are Muslim and 30.9% Christian. The city also commands immense religious significance, deriving from its status as the hometown of [Jesus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus/), the central figure of Christianity and a prophet in Islam.
