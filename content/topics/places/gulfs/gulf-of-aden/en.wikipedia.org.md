excerpt: >-
  The **Gulf of Aden** (Arabic: خليج عدن; Somali: *Gacanka Cadmeed*) is a deepwater gulf of the [Indian Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean/) between [Yemen](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen/) to the north, the Arabian Sea to the east, [Djibouti](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djibouti/) to the west, and the Guardafui Channel, Socotra and Somalia to the south. In the northwest, it connects with the [Red Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea/) through the [Bab-el-Mandeb](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bab-el-Mandeb/) strait, and it connects with the Arabian Sea to the east. To the west, it narrows into the Gulf of Tadjoura in Djibouti. The Aden Ridge lies along the middle of the Gulf and is causing it to widen about 15mm per year.
