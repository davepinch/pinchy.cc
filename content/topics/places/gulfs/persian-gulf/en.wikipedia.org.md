  The **Persian Gulf** (Persian: خلیج فارس, romanized: *xalij-e fârs*, lit. 'Gulf of Fars', pronounced [xæliːdʒe fɒːɾs]), sometimes called the **Arabian Gulf** (Arabic: اَلْخَلِيْجُ ٱلْعَرَبِيُّ, romanized: *Al-Khalīj al-ˁArabī*), is a mediterranean sea in [West Asia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Asia/). The body of water is an extension of the Indian Ocean located between [Iran](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran/) and the Arabian Peninsula. It is connected to the Gulf of Oman in the east by the Strait of Hormuz. The Arvand or Shatt al-Arab river delta forms the northwest shoreline.
