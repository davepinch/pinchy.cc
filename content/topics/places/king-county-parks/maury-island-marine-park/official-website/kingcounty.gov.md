  Maury Island Marine Park is located on the east side of Maury Island, a peninsula of Vashon Island. One of the largest undeveloped properties located directly on Puget Sound with more than 1 mile of shoreline, the park provides stunning views of the East Passage, Mount Rainier and the Cascade Mountains. The site had significance for early Native Americans and is referenced in a legend about Snake People who arrived from the mainland as part of war party.
