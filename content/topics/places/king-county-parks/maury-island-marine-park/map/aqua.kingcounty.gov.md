excerpt: >-
  Maury Island Marine Park is located on the east side of Maury Island which is connected to Vashon Island. There is more than one mile of natural shoreline with stunning views of Mount Rainier and the Cascade Mountains. The park is a former gravel mine and contains rare stands of the Pacific madrone tree. The accessible shoreline allows for scuba diving and an excellent beach walk to observe marine life with a salt marsh at the north end.
