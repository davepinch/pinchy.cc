  **Yukon** (/ˈjuːkɒn/ *YOO-kon*; Canadian French: [jukõ]; formerly called the **Yukon Territory** and referred to as **the Yukon**) is the smallest and westernmost of Canada's three territories. It is the third-least populated province or territory in Canada, with a population of 45,148 as of 2023. However, Whitehorse, the territorial capital, is the largest settlement in any of the three territories.
