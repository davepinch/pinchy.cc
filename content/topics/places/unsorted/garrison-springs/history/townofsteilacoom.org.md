  Garrison Springs are the name given to the springs and creek which flow from Western State Hospital into Puget Sound by Chambers Creek. The springs provided water for the United States Military garrison at Fort Steilacoom. The details of the building of a water ram to pipe the water from the canyon floor to the military garrison on the plain above are recorded in the diary of Lieutenant August V. Kautz.
