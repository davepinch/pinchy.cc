excerpt: >-
  Located on the coast of Orcas Island, this 57 acre forested preserve protects natural examples of dry-site forest communities dominated by Douglas-fir, Pacific madrone, salal and ocean spray, representing the "rain shadow" vegetation that occurs in the San Juan Islands. Bald eagles feed and nest on the preserve and seals haul out on the rocky shoreline.  A small state-owned recreation site on the point is used for marine mammal study, kayak and small boat camping, as well as outdoor education through nearby, privately owned Camp Orkila.
