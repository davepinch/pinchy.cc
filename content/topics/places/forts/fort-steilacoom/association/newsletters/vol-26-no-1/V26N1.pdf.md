excerpt: >-
  Brevet Captain Delancy Floyd Jones was a bit of a dandy. And like most dandies was somewhat full of himself. He claimed an aristocratic background, was proud of his familyâ€™s lineage, and believed that small hands and feet were evidence of that heritage. Floyd Jones had small hands and feet. Also, perhaps his hyphenated last name contributed to his feelings of superiority. Floyd-Jones was a good soldier despite his aloofness. Lieutenant August Kautz describes him as a man of good habits and beyond reproach in his personal conduct, but he had one personal trait that distinguished him from all others at Fort Steilacoom. Floyd-Jones changed his shirt every day.
