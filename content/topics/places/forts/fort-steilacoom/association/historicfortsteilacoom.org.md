  Fort Steilacoom is located on the grounds of the Western State Hospital, overseen by the Washington State Department of Social & Health Services and cared for and paid for by the Historic Fort Steilacoom Association, (HFSA). In 1978, the final four remaining buildings were in deplorable condition. Plans for the hospital included demolition of the fort structures. Preservation efforts, in the early 1980s, by the Washington State Historic Preservation Office, Heritage League of Pierce County, and HFSA restored these officersâ€™ quarters, which became the Fort Steilacoom Museum.
