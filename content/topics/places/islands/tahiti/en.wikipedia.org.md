  **Tahiti** (English: /təˈhiːti/; Tahitian [taˈhiti]; French pronunciation: [ta.iti]; previously also known as **Otaheite**) is the largest island of the Windward group of the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It is located in the central part of the [Pacific Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean/) and the nearest major landmass is [Australia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia/). Divided into two parts, Tahiti Nui (bigger, northwestern part) and Tahiti Iti (smaller, southeastern part), the island was formed from volcanic activity; it is high and mountainous with surrounding coral reefs. Its population was 189,517 in 2017, making it by far the most populous island in French Polynesia and accounting for 68.7% of its total population; the 2022 Census resulted in a population of 191,779.
