  **Whidbey Island** (historical spellings **Whidby**, **Whitbey**, or **Whitby**) is the largest of the islands composing [Island County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_County,_Washington/), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/), in the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), and the largest island in Washington State. (The other large island is Camano Island, east of Whidbey.) Whidbey is about 30 miles (48 km) north of [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle/), and lies between the [Olympic Peninsula](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Peninsula/) and the [I-5](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_5_in_Washington/) corridor of western Washington. The island forms the northern boundary of [Puget Sound](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound/). It is home to Naval Air Station Whidbey Island. The state parks and natural forests are home to numerous old growth trees.
