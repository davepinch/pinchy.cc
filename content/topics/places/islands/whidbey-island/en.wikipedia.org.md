> **Whidbey Island** (historical spellings **Whidby**, **Whitbey**, or **Whitby**) is the largest of the islands composing [Island County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_County,_Washington), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)), in the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), and the largest island in Washington State. (The other large island is Camano Island, east of Whidbey.) Whidbey is about 30 miles (48 km) north of [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle), and lies between the Olympic Peninsula and the I-5 corridor of western Washington. The island forms the northern boundary of [Puget Sound](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound). It is home to Naval Air Station Whidbey Island. The state parks and natural forests are home to numerous old growth trees.
