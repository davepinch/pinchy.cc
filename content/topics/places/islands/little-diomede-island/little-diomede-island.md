  - "Village permission should be sought (via letter) prior to visiting along with arrangements for transportation, housing and food. Self sufficiency is advised. Transportation to and from the island is restricted and expensive." # atlasobscura know before you go
  - "My background is someone who has traveled to Little Diomede. The first step would be to talk to the school about renting a place to sleep. Â¶ Second, you would need to fly to Nome on Alaska Air. There is a helicopter service to Diomede. You will probably fly to Wales, Alaska and catch the helicopter there. People are correct that air service is normally once a week. If you go to Diomede you need to plan to stay a while."
