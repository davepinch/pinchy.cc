  My background is someone who has traveled to Little Diomede. The first step would be to talk to the school about renting a place to sleep. ¶ Second, you would need to fly to Nome on Alaska Air. There is a helicopter service to Diomede. You will probably fly to Wales, Alaska and catch the helicopter there. People are correct that air service is normally once a week. If you go to Diomede you need to plan to stay a while.
