excerpt: >-
  Culmback Dam and Spada Lake are a lovely retreat off Highway 2, just east of Sultan and up the Sultan Basin Road. Spada Lake is a source of drinking water for the City of Everett, so in-water activities are prohibited, but there are hiking trails that circle the lake and nearby just waiting for your exploration.
