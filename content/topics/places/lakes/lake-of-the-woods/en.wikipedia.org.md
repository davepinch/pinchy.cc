excerpt: >-
  **Lake of the Woods** (French: *Lac des Bois*; Ojibwe: *Pikwedina Sagainan*, lit.â€‰'"inland lake of the sand hills"') is a lake occupying parts of the Canadian provinces of [Ontario](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario/) and [Manitoba](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba/) and the U.S. state of [Minnesota](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota/). Lake of the Woods is over 70 miles (110 km) long and wide, containing more than 14,552 islands and 65,000 miles (105,000 km) of shoreline. It is fed by the Rainy River, Shoal Lake, Kakagi Lake and other smaller rivers. The lake drains into the Winnipeg River and then into Lake Winnipeg. Ultimately, its outflow goes north through the Nelson River to Hudson Bay.
