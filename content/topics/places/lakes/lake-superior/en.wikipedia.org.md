  **Lake Superior** is the largest freshwater lake in the world by surface area and the third-largest by volume, holding 10% of the world's surface fresh water. Located in central [North America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America), it is the northernmost and westernmost of the Great Lakes of North America, straddling the Canadaâ€“United States border with the Canadian province of [Ontario](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario/) to the north and east and the U.S. states of [Minnesota](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota) to the west and [Wisconsin](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin) and [Michigan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan) to the south. It drains into Lake Huron via St. Marys River, then through the lower Great Lakes to the St. Lawrence River and ultimately the [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean).
