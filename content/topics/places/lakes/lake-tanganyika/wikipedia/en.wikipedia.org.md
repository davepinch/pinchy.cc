excerpt: >-
  **Lake Tanganyika** (/ˌtæŋɡənˈjiːkə, -ɡæn-/ *TANG-gən-YEE-kə*, *-⁠gan-*; Kirundi: *Ikiyaga ca Tanganyika*) is an African Great Lake. It is the second-oldest freshwater lake in the world, the second-largest by volume, and the second deepest, in all cases after Lake Baikal in Siberia. It is the world's longest freshwater lake. The lake is shared among four countries—[Tanzania](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzania/), the [Democratic Republic of the Congo](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo/) (the DRC), [Burundi](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burundi/), and [Zambia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambia/—with Tanzania (46%) and the DRC (40%) possessing the majority of the lake. It drains into the Congo River system and ultimately into the [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean/).
