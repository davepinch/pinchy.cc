  **Lake Sammamish** is a freshwater lake 8 miles (13 km) east of [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle/) in [King County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_County,_Washington/), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)), [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States/). The lake is 7 miles (11 km) long and 1.5 miles (2 km) wide, with a maximum depth of 105 feet (32 m) and a surface area of 8 sq mi (21 km2). It lies east of [Lake Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Washington/) and west of the Sammamish Plateau, and stretches from [Issaquah](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issaquah,_Washington/) in the south to [Redmond](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington/) in the north. At Issaquah it is fed by Issaquah Creek, and at Redmond it drains to Lake Washington via the [Sammamish River](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammamish_River/), named after the native people who once lived along its entire length.
