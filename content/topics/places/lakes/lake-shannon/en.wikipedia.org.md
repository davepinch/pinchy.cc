  **Lake Shannon** is a long, narrow reservoir on the Baker River in Skagit County, Washington in the United States. Formed in the 1920s by the construction of an arch dam just above the town of Concrete, the lake is approximately 7.5 miles (12 km) long and averages 0.6 miles (1 km) wide when full. Located just outside the western boundary of North Cascades National Park, Lake Shannon serves as the lower reservoir for Puget Sound Energy's Baker River Hydroelectric Project.
