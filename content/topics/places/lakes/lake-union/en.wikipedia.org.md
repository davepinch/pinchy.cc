excerpt: >-
  **Lake Union** (Lushootseed: x̌ax̌čuʔ) is a freshwater lake located entirely within the city limits of [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle/), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/), [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States/). It is a major part of the [Lake Washington Ship Canal](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Washington_Ship_Canal/), which carries fresh water from the much larger [Lake Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Washington/) on the east to [Puget Sound](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound/) on the west. The easternmost point of the lake is the Ship Canal Bridge, which carries [Interstate 5](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_5_in_Washington/) over the eastern arm of the lake and separates Lake Union from Portage Bay. Lake Union is the namesake of the neighborhoods located on three of its shores: Eastlake, Westlake and South Lake Union. Notable destinations on the lake include Lake Union Park, the Museum of History & Industry (MOHAI), and the Center for Wooden Boats on the southern shore and Gas Works Park on the northern shore.
