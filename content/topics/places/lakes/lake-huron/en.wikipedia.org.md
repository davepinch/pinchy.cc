excerpt: >-
  **Lake Huron** (/ˈhjʊərɒn, -ən/ HURE-on, -⁠ən) is one of the five Great Lakes of [North America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America/). Hydrologically, it comprises the easterly portion of Lake Michigan–Huron, having the same surface elevation as [Lake Michigan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Michigan/), to which it is connected by the 5-mile-wide (8.0 km), 20-fathom-deep (120 ft; 37 m) Straits of Mackinac. It is shared on the north and east by the Canadian province of [Ontario](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario/) and on the south and west by the U.S. state of [Michigan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan/). The name of the lake is derived from early French explorers who named it for the indigenous people they knew as Huron (Wyandot) inhabiting the region.
