  **Green Lake** (Lushootseed: dxʷƛ̕əš) is a freshwater lake in north central Seattle, Washington, within Green Lake Park. The park is surrounded by the [Green Lake](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Lake,_Seattle/) neighborhood to the north and east, the Wallingford neighborhood to the south, the Phinney Ridge neighborhood to the west, and Woodland Park to the southwest. It is a glacial lake, its basin having been dug 50,000 years ago by the Vashon glacier, which also created Lake Washington, Union, Bitter and Haller Lakes.
