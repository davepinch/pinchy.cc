  **Franklin Falls** is a waterfall on the South fork of the [Snoqualmie River](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoqualmie_River/), the first of three major waterfalls on the South Fork Snoqualmie River. The falls are located near Snoqualmie Pass in [King County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_County,_Washington/), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/), [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States/), between the north and south lanes of [Interstate 90](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_90/), just east of exit 47. The falls actually consist of three tiers, totaling about 135 feet (41 m). The first drop is a very scenic 15-foot (4.6 m) block-shaped fall. The second drop is a 25-foot (7.6 m) fanning cascade. The final drop begins as a 25-foot slide, which bends to the right, then plunges over the final 70-foot (21 m) drop seen from the base of the falls. The falls are popular canyoneering destination. The upper two drops are north of the freeway.
