> The **Snoqualmie Tunnel** is a former railroad tunnel near Snoqualmie Pass in the U.S. state of [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)), located east of [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle). The tunnel crosses the Cascade Range about three miles (5 km) south of the pass, which is used by Interstate 90, on the border between [King County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_County,_Washington) and [Kittitas County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kittitas_County,_Washington). It is 11,894 feet (2.253 mi; 3.625 km) long and is at an approximate elevation of 2,600 feet (790 m) above sea level, just north of [Keechelus Lake](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keechelus_Lake). Its east portal is at Hyak.
