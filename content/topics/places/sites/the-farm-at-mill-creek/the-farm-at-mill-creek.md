*The Farm at Mill Creek* is a project in [Mill Creek](/mill-creek/), [Washington](/washington/) to develop a site for commercial and residential use. It contains wetlands that will be developed with public access. I encountered this area in February 2024 when driving nearby. More information can be found on the City of Mill Creek [website](https://www.cityofmillcreek.com/cms/One.aspx?portalId=9100937&pageId=12720235) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20230131194040/https://www.cityofmillcreek.com/cms/One.aspx?portalId=9100937&pageId=12760145)).
