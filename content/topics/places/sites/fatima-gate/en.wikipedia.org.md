excerpt: >-
  **Fatima Gate**, also known as the Good Fence Crossing, is a former border crossing between [Lebanon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon) and [Israel](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel/). On the Lebanese side, it is close to the village of [Kfar Kila](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kafr_Kila,_Lebanon/) and on the Israeli side, it is west of Metula. The crossing has been closed since the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon at the end of the 1982-2000 South Lebanon conflict, and since the summer of 2000 has been the site of many anti-Israeli demonstrations and cross-border stone throwing from Lebanon to Israel.
