excerpt: >-
  **Beacon Food Forest** is a 7-acre food forest in development adjacent to [Jefferson Park](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Park_(Seattle)/) on [Beacon Hill](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beacon_Hill,_Seattle/) in [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle/), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/) in the vicinity of 15th Avenue South and South Dakota Street. As the area sits on land owned by Seattle Public Utilities, it is believed to be the largest food forest on public land in the United States. The project also has more traditional private allotments, similar to those in other local P-Patch gardens.
