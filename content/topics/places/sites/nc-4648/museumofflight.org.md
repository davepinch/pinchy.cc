excerpt: >-
  The Alexander Eaglerock series was one of several civilian aircraft brands that emerged after World War I. Winging away from the Denver-based Alexander Aircraft Company at "mile-high" altitudes, equipped with a Curtiss OX-5, 90-horsepower engine, Eaglerocks joined Wacos, Travel Airs, and Swallows as the most popular general aviation aircraft of the late 1920s.
