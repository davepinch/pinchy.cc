    It’s also the site of two landslides—one massive, ancient slide that is too big to appreciate from the ground but visible in lidar imagery, and one smaller but still impressive slide from 2009 with a 90-foot-tall scarp. Both slides sit on the shoulder of aptly named Slide Mountain.

    The rocks near Racehorse Creek are the [Chuckanut Formation](/chuckanut-formation/), a 34 to 56 million-year-old sedimentary formation. When it was first deposited, this tropical landscape hosted a floodplain and river system with swamp-dwelling vegetation that was later fossilized.

    Fossil hunters exploring the Racehorse Creek area found a 10-inch imprint of a Diatryma foot, a 6.5-foot-tall flightless bird that stalked the area 50 million years ago. The slab containing the footprint was too large to transport easily. It was airlifted via helicopter to Western Washington University where it’s currently on display.
