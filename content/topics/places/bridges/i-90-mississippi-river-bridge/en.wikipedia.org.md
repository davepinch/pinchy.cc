excerpt: >-
  The **I-90 Mississippi River Bridge**, or the **Dresbach Bridge**, consists of a pair of parallel bridges that traverse the [Mississippi River](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River/), connecting the La Crosse, [Wisconsin](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin/) area to Dresbach in rural Winona County, [Minnesota](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota/). The current bridge was fully opened to traffic in October 2016, replacing a previous 1967 plate girder bridge. It is part of the Interstate 90 route. There is another automobile crossing a few miles south of this bridge; the Mississippi River Bridge, a combination of two bridges, and the La Crosse West Channel Bridge, connecting La Crescent, Minnesota and La Crosse, Wisconsin.
