  The **Stillwater Bridge** (alternatively known as the **Stillwater Lift Bridge**, **St. Croix River Bridge at Stillwater**, **Mn/DOT Bridge #4654**, and **Wis/DOT Bridge #M-61**) is a vertical-lift bridge crossing the [St. Croix River](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Croix_River_(Wisconsin–Minnesota)/) between [Stillwater, Minnesota](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stillwater,_Minnesota/), and [Houlton, Wisconsin](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houlton,_Wisconsin/). It formerly connected Minnesota State Highway 36 and Wisconsin Highway 64. Around 18,000 vehicles crossed the bridge daily. The new St. Croix Crossing bridge crossing the St. Croix river valley to the south of Stillwater replaced its purpose, having opened to highway traffic on August 2, 2017, leaving the Stillwater Lift Bridge to be preserved and to be converted to bicycle/pedestrian use.
