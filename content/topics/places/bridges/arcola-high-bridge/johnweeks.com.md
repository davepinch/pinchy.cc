  The Arcola High Bridge is the most spectacular river crossing in the Twin Cities metro area. It crosses the nearly mile wide Saint Croix River Valley between the village of Arcola, Minnesota, and Somerset, Wisconsin. It consists of five huge steel arches that tower nearly 200 feet over the bottom of the valley.  
note: The Arcole High Bridge is formally named the Soo Line High Bridge.
