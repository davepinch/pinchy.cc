excerpt: >-
  The **Tacoma Narrows Bridge** is a pair of twin suspension bridges that span the Tacoma Narrows strait of [Puget Sound](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound/) in [Pierce County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierce_County,_Washington/), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)). The bridges connect the city of [Tacoma](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma,_Washington/) with the [Kitsap Peninsula](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsap_Peninsula/) and carry State Route 16 (known as Primary State Highway 14 until 1964) over the strait. Historically, the name "Tacoma Narrows Bridge" has applied to the original bridge nicknamed "Galloping Gertie", which opened in July 1940, but collapsed possibly because of aeroelastic flutter four months later, as well as the replacement of the original bridge which opened in 1950 and still stands today as the westbound lanes of the present-day two-bridge complex.
