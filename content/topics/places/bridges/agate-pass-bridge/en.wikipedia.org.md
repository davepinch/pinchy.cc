  The **Agate Pass Bridge** is a structural steel truss cantilever bridge spanning Agate Pass, connecting Bainbridge Island to the Kitsap Peninsula. It was built in 1950, and it replaced a car ferry service which dated from the 1920s. The bridge provides a direct route along Washington State Route 305 between Seattle, via the Seattle-Bainbridge Island ferry, and the Kitsap Peninsula.
