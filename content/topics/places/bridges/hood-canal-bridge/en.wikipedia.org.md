  The **Hood Canal Bridge** (officially **William A. Bugge Bridge**) is a floating bridge in the northwest [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States/), located in western [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/). It carries State Route 104 across [Hood Canal](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hood_Canal/) in [Puget Sound](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound/) and connects the [Olympic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Peninsula/) and [Kitsap](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsap_Peninsula/) Peninsulas. At 7,869 feet (1.490 mi; 2.398 km) in length (floating portion 6,521 feet (1.235 mi; 1.988 km)), it is the longest floating bridge in the world located in a saltwater tidal basin, and the third longest floating bridge overall. It opened in 1961 and was the second concrete floating bridge constructed in Washington. Since that time, it has become a vital link for local residents, freight haulers, commuters, and recreational travelers. The convenience it provides has had a major impact on economic development, especially in eastern [Jefferson County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_County,_Washington/).
