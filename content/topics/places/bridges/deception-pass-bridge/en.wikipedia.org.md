  **Deception Pass Bridge** is the common name for two two-lane bridges on Washington State Route 20 connecting [Whidbey Island](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whidbey_Island) in [Island County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_County,_Washington), to [Fidalgo Island](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidalgo_Island/) in [Skagit County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skagit_County,_Washington), in the U.S. state of [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)). It was a Washington State Highways project, and included project elements built by young workers from the Civilian Conservation Corps. Completion of the bridge was a factor in the decision to build Naval Air Station Whidbey Island and helped Oak Harbor flourish. The bridge is a commonly photographed landmark of the Puget Sound region.
