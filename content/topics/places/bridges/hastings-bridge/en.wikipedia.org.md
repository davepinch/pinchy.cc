  The **Hastings Bridge** is a free standing tied-arch bridge that spans the Mississippi River in Hastings, Minnesota, United States. It was designed by Parsons and was built in 2013 by Lunda Construction Company for $119,830,000. The Hastings Bridge replaces the former Hastings High Bridge, which was built in 1951 and demolished in 2013 when the replacement bridge was completed. The Hastings High Bridge had been scheduled to be torn down and replaced in 2019, but after the I-35W bridge collapse in Minneapolis, the MNDOT re-prioritized the replacement and construction of the new bridge started in 2010.
