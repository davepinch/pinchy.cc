excerpt: >-
  Western State Hospital is located on the site of historic Fort Steilacoom, which served as a military post from 1849 to 1868 until the federal government abandoned it. The Washington territory purchased the fort with the intent of turning it into a hospital for people who suffered from mental illness. The hospital, then called the Insane Asylum of Washington Territory, opened in 1871 with 15 male and six female patients.
