  In this video we take a trip back in time to explore the infamous lost world of Doggerland. The sunken landmass between mainland Europe and the British isles. Once home to megafauna, the mammoth steppe and ancient humans, Doggerland would have been a rich complex world. Today we are going to explore they mysteries of this European Atlantis from its rise to its eventual apocalyptic collapse that some speculate was in part due to a tsunami.
