excerpt: >-
  The **Akkadian Empire** (/əˈkeɪdiən/) was the first ancient empire of [Mesopotamia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia), succeeding the long-lived civilization of [Sumer](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer). Centered on the city of Akkad (/ˈækæd/) and its surrounding region, the empire would unite Akkadian and Sumerian speakers under one rule and exercised significant influence across Mesopotamia, the Levant, and Anatolia, sending military expeditions as far south as Dilmun and Magan (modern Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Oman) in the Arabian Peninsula.
