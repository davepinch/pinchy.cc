  **Bethsaida** (/bɛθˈseɪ.ɪdə/ *beth-SAY-id-ə*; from Ancient Greek: Βηθσαϊδά, romanized: *Bēthsaïdá*; from Aramaic and Hebrew: בֵּית צַידָה, romanized: *Bēṯ Ṣayḏā*, lit. 'House of the Fisherman' or 'House of the Hunter', from the Hebrew root צ-י-ד; Arabic: بيت صيدا, romanized: *Bayt Ṣaydā*), also known as **Julias** or **Julia** (Ancient Greek: Ἰουλία, romanized: *Ioulía*), is a place mentioned in the New Testament. Julias lay in an administrative district known as Gaulonitis. Historians have suggested that the name is also referenced in rabbinic literature under the epithet *Ṣayḏān* (Hebrew: צַידָן).
