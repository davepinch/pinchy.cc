excerpt: >-
  The **Cascade Range** or **Cascades** is a major mountain range of western [North America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America/), extending from southern [British Columbia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia/) through [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/) and [Oregon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon/) to Northern California. It includes both non-volcanic mountains, such as many of those in the North Cascades, and the notable volcanoes known as the High Cascades. The small part of the range in British Columbia is referred to as the Canadian Cascades or, locally, as the Cascade Mountains. The highest peak in the range is [Mount Rainier](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rainier/) in Washington at 14,411 feet (4,392 m).
