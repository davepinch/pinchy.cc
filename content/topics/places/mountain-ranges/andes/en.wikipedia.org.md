  The **Andes** (/ˈændiːz/ AN-deez), **Andes Mountains** or **Andean Mountain Range** (Spanish: *Cordillera de los Andes*; Quechua: *Anti*) are the longest continental mountain range in the world, forming a continuous highland along the western edge of South America. The range is 8,900 km (5,530 mi) long and 200 to 700 km (124 to 435 mi) wide (widest between 18°S and 20°S latitude) and has an average height of about 4,000 m (13,123 ft). The Andes extend from South to North through seven South American countries: Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela.
