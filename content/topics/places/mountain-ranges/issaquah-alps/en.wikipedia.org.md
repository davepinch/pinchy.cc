excerpt: >-
  The **Issaquah Alps** is the unofficial name for the highlands near [Issaquah, Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issaquah,_Washington/), a suburb of [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle/), including Cougar Mountain, [Squak Mountain](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squak_Mountain/), Tiger Mountain, Taylor Mountain, [Rattlesnake Ridge](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rattlesnake_Ridge/), Rattlesnake Mountain, and Grand Ridge. The term was invented in 1977 by noted nature author Harvey Manning within the pages of his trail guidebook Footsore 1, elevating their status from foothills to "Alps" to advocate preservation. Manning himself lived on a developed section of Cougar Mountain in his "200 meter hut".
