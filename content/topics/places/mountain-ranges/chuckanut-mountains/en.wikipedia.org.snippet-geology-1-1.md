  The [Chuckanut Mountains](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuckanut_Mountains/) were formed by the folding of the [Chuckanut Formation](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuckanut_Formation) (which is predominantly made up of layers of 55-million-year-old [sandstone](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandstone), conglomerate, [shale](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shale), and bituminous and sub-bituminous coal) and the later Huntingdon Formation (predominantly shale and sandstone) on top, as well as an exposed section of pre-Jurassic-age phyllite
