  **Hood Canal** is a fjord forming the western lobe, and one of the four main basins of [Puget Sound](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound) in the U.S. state of [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)). It is one of the minor bodies of water that constitute the [Salish Sea](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salish_Sea). Hood Canal is not a canal in the sense of an artificial waterway—it is a natural feature.
