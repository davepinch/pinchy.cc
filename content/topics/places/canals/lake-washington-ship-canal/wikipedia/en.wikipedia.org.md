excerpt: >-
  The **Lake Washington Ship Canal**, which runs through the city of [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle/), connects the fresh water body of [Lake Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Washington/) with the salt water inland sea of [Puget Sound](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound/). The Hiram M. Chittenden Locks accommodate the approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) difference in water level between Lake Washington and the sound. The canal runs east–west and connects [Union Bay](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Bay_(Seattle)/), the [Montlake Cut](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montlake_Cut/), Portage Bay, [Lake Union](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Union/), the Fremont Cut, Salmon Bay, and Shilshole Bay, which is part of the sound.
