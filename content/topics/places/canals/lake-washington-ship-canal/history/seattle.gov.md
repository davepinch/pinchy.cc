title: "Lake Washington Ship Canal (seattle.gov)"
excerpt: >-
  The grand opening of the Lake Washington Ship Canal was held on July 4, 1917. Designed by Seattle district engineer Hiram Chittenden of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the canal's construction was the result of more than five decades of discussion on how to connect the saltwater of Puget Sound to the freshwater of Lake Washington via Lake Union.  Early planners envisioned heavy use by coal and naval vessels, but today the locks are predominantly filled with pleasure crafts. The City of Seattle's role included engineering, legal, and public works projects as new bridges, roads, water supply infrastructure and more were required to accommodate the implications of the Ship Canal on Seattle's shape and size. The exhibits below provide insight into how the Ship Canal shaped Seattle's social, physical, and environmental history.
