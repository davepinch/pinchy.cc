  The **Fremont Rocket** is a sculpture of a rocket in the Fremont neighborhood of [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle/), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/), [US](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States/). The rocket had been displayed at an army surplus store in Seattle's [Belltown](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belltown,_Seattle/) neighborhood until 1991, when a news radio broadcast said the store was dismantling its "circa 1950 Cold War rocket fuselage [sic]", prompting the Fremont Business Association to buy it for $750. The Business Association took a few years to overcome problems with assembling and erecting the rocket, finally placing it at its current location at N 35th St. and Evanston Ave N. on June 3, 1994.
