  ***Waiting for the Interurban***, also known as ***People Waiting for the Interurban***, is a 1978 cast aluminum sculpture collection in the [Fremont](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont,_Seattle/) neighborhood of [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle/). It is located on the southeast corner of N. 34th Street and Fremont Avenue N., just east of the northern end of the [Fremont Bridge](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_Bridge_(Seattle)/). It consists of six people and a dog waiting for public transportation — specifically, the Seattle-Everett Interurban. While the interurban railway ran through Fremont from 1910 until 1939, it stopped on Fremont Avenue rather than N. 34th Street, which the statue faces.
