  The **Seattle Convention Center** (**SCC**), formerly the **Washington State Convention Center** (**WSCC**), is a convention center in [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle/), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)), [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). It consists of two buildings in Downtown Seattle with exhibition halls and meeting rooms: Arch along Pike Street and Summit on the north side of Pine Street. The former straddles [Interstate 5](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_5_in_Washington/) and connects with [Freeway Park](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeway_Park/). The convention center was planned in the late 1970s and funded through $90 million in bonds issued by the state legislature.
