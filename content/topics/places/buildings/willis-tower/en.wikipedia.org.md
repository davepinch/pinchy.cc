  The **Willis Tower** (originally the **Sears Tower**) is a 110-story, 1,451-foot (442.3 m) skyscraper in the Loop community area of [Chicago](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago) in [Illinois](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois), [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). Designed by architect Bruce Graham and engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), it opened in 1973 as the world's tallest building, a title that it held for nearly 25 years. It is the third-tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, as well as the 23rd-tallest in the world. Each year, more than 1.7 million people visit the Skydeck observation deck, the highest in the United States, making it one of Chicago's most popular tourist destinations.
