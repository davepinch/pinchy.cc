  This website has many interesting historical pictures that have been carefully collected and published for the enjoyment of visitors. It is an old-school website, reminding me of the early good days of the web.
excerpt: >-
  The goal of this website is to preserve the visual imagery of Adolph Sutroâ€™s Victorian Cliff House. It was neither the first structure nor the last to carry the name of Cliff House, but it was certainly the most grand. Sadly, its existence was short-lived. It was constructed in 1896 and, like so many wooden structures of that era, burned completely to the ground in September of 1907.
