  The **Cliff House** is a neo-classical style building perched on the headland above the cliffs just north of Ocean Beach, in the Outer Richmond neighborhood of [San Francisco](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco/), [California](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California/). The building overlooks the site of the [Sutro Baths](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutro_Baths/) ruins, [Seal Rocks](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_Rocks_(San_Francisco,_California)/), and is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, operated by the National Park Service (NPS). The Cliff House is owned by the NPS; the building's terrace hosts a room-sized camera obscura.
