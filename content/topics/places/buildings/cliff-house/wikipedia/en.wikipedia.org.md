excerpt: >-
  The **Cliff House** is a neo-classical style building perched on the headland above the cliffs just north of Ocean Beach. Located on the West Side of San Francisco in the city's Outer Richmond neighborhood, the building overlooks the site of the Sutro Baths ruins, Seal Rocks, and is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and operated by the National Park Service (NPS). The Cliff House is owned by the NPS; the building's terrace hosts a room-sized camera obscura.
