author: David Wilma
excerpt: >-
  The Ravenna and Roosevelt neighborhoods of Seattle, also known as Ravenna-Bryant and Roosevelt-Fairview, extend north from the University of Washington, from Union Bay to Interstate 5 and Lake City Way NE. Ravenna originated before the university moved into the area and Roosevelt developed after the automobile. Both were heavily influenced by the university community and each reflects that in different ways.
