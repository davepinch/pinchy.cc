excerpt: >-
  Although Seattle's Maple Leaf neighborhood appeared in the 1890s as a dream of real estate developers, the hilltop community northeast of Green Lake was slow to grow. The last half of the twentieth century saw dramatic changes to the area, but Maple Leaf remained a stable home to middle-class families. The residents were late to organize themselves politically, but their patient and focused persistence soon gained nationwide recognition.
