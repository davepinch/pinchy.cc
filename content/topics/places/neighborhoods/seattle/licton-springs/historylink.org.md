excerpt: >-
  Licton Springs celebrates a long history as both a unique recreational spot and a commercial crossroads. The residential neighborhood in north Seattle is wedged between the busy corridors of Interstate-5 and Aurora Avenue. It takes its name from Liq'tid or Licton, the Salish word for the reddish mud of the springs -- one of the few Puget Sound Salish words still used as a place name.
