excerpt: >-
  **Montlake** is a wealthy residential neighborhood in central [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle/), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/). It is located along the Montlake Cut of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, bounded to the north by Portage Bay, to the east by the Washington Park Arboretum, and to the south and west by Interlaken Park. [Capitol Hill](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill,_Seattle/) is on its south and west sides, and the University of Washington campus lies across the Montlake Cut to the north. State Route 520 runs through the northern tip of Montlake, isolating four blocks from the rest of the neighborhood. The (unofficial) City Clerk's map of Montlake considers it to extend further west, past Interlake Park, extending to Broadway Avenue E. and, between Lynn Street and State Route 520, all the way to Interstate 5.
