excerpt: >-
  **First Hill** is a neighborhood in [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle/), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/), [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States/). It is named for the hill on which it is located, which in turn is so named for being the first hill encountered while traveling east from downtown Seattle toward [Lake Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Washington/). First Hill is bounded on the west by Interstate 5, beyond which is Downtown, on the north by E. Pike and E. Madison Streets, beyond which is [Capitol Hill](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill,_Seattle/), and on the south by Yesler Way, beyond which is the International District. The City of Seattle provides conflicting information about its eastern limit, beyond which are Cherry Hill and the [Central District](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_District,_Seattle/). Some describe it as being bounded by [Broadway](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_(Seattle)/) and Boren Avenues, while others describe it as being bounded by 12th Avenue.
