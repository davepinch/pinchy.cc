excerpt: >-
  **Bitter Lake** is a neighborhood in [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle/), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/), [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States/), named after its most notable feature, Bitter Lake. It was a mostly natural forest of Douglas-fir and [Western Redcedar](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuja_plicata/), inhabited by Native Americans, until the late 19th century. Development especially picked up when the Seattle-to-Everett Interurban streetcar reached the lake in 1906. A sawmill operated in the area until 1913, when most of the trees had been cut down.
