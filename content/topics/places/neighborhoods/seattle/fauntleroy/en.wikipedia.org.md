excerpt: >-
  **Fauntleroy** is a neighborhood in the southwest corner of [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle/), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/). Part of [West Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Seattle/) and situated on [Puget Sound](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound/)'s Fauntleroy Cove (into which Fauntleroy Creek flows from its source in Fauntleroy Park), it faces [Vashon Island](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vashon,_Washington/), Blake Island, and the Kitsap Peninsula to the west. On sunny days, many locations in the neighborhood offer views of the Olympic Mountains, which are about 40 miles (64 km) to the west. The neighborhood adjoins Lincoln Park to the north, Fauntlee Hills to the east, and Arbor Heights to the south. Within Fauntleroy is an area known as Endolyne (the "end of the line" of the Fauntleroy Park streetcar route in the early 1900s). Fauntleroy is home to an eponymous Washington State Ferries terminal, providing service to Vashon Island and Southworth.
