excerpt: >-
  **Belltown** is the most densely populated neighborhood in [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)), [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), located on the city's downtown waterfront on land that was artificially flattened as part of a regrading project. Formerly a low-rent, semi-industrial arts district, in recent decades it has transformed into a neighborhood of trendy restaurants, boutiques, nightclubs, and residential towers as well as warehouses and art galleries. The area is named after William Nathaniel Bell, on whose land claim the neighborhood was built.
