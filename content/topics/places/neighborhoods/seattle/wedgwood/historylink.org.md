excerpt: >-
  Wedgwood (sometimes misspelled Wedgewood) was born of the housing boom of World War II, but its history reaches back to prehistoric times. Native Americans used the Wedgwood Rock as a landmark. In later years, picnickers, university students, climbers, and even hippies enjoyed it too. One of the farms in the neighborhood became the first P-Patch in Seattle. Wedgwood is a neighborhood in northeast Seattle, north of Ravenna, along what would become 35th Avenue NE.
