  **Lake City** is the northeast region of [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle/), centered along Lake City Way NE (SR-522), 7–8 miles (11–13 km) northeast of Downtown Seattle. A broader definition of the Lake City area includes all the land between 15th Avenue NE and [Lake Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Washington/), and between NE 95th and 98th streets to the Seattle city limits at NE 145th Street. Lake City encompasses much of the Thornton Creek watershed, the focus of a long restoration campaign by citizens and Seattle Public Utilities staff to enhance the residential environment of Lake City.
