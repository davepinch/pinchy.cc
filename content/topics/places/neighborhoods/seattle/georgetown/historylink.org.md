author: David Wilma
excerpt: >-
  Georgetown became a Seattle neighborhood through annexation in 1910. It is but was not always a tiny enclave of homes and businesses hemmed in by factories, warehouses, freeways, railroads, barge terminals, and airplanes. It was not always even dry land. Georgetown is located about three miles south of downtown Seattle, formerly along the winding Duwamish River. The landscape changed when the Duwamish was straightened: The center of Georgetown lies about a mile inland.
