author: Louis Fiset
excerpt: >-
  The Loyal Heights neighborhood began in 1890 as a bedroom suburb of the town of Ballard and continues the same role in the northwestern corner of contemporary Seattle. The area is situated above NW 65th Street, well north of Ballard's primary commercial district. The shores of Puget Sound and 15th Avenue NW define its western and eastern boundaries, and the former city limits at NW 85th Street define its northern extension. Loyal Heights owes its name and a large part of its existence to a migrant mid-westerner, Harry W. Treat (1865-1922), who developed and promoted a large tract of land above NW 75th Street, beginning in 1906.
