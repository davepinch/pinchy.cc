  **Northlake** is a neighborhood in [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle/), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)/), that consists of the southern part of [Wallingford](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallingford,_Seattle/), below N 40th Street. It is so named for being on the northern shore of [Lake Union](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Union/). Landmarks include the Northlake Shipyard, [Gas Works Park](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_Works_Park/), the Wallingford Steps art installation, and Ivar's Salmon House. Circa 1900, the eastern part of Northlake was known as Latona, and the John Stanford International School building was formerly the Latona School. Nowadays, the name Latona is likely to refer to anywhere along Latona Ave. NE from Northlake north to NE 65th St. near Green Lake.
