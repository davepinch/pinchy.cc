excerpt: >-
  ***Going Postal*** is a fantasy novel by British writer [Terry Pratchett](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett/), the 33rd book in his *Discworld* series, released in the United Kingdom on 25 September 2004. Unlike most of Pratchett's Discworld novels, *Going Postal* is divided into chapters, a feature previously seen only in Pratchett's children's books and the Science of Discworld series. These chapters begin with a synopsis of philosophical themes, in a similar manner to some Victorian novels and, notably, to Jules Verne stories. The title refers to both the contents of the novel, as well as to the term 'going postal'.
