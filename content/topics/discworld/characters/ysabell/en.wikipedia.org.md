excerpt: >-
  **Lady Ysabell** is the adopted daughter of [Death](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_(Discworld)/). He saved her life after her parents died in the Great Nef desert when she was a baby. Why he did so is uncertain. "He didn't feel sorry for me, he never feels anything â€¦ He probably thought sorry for me" Ysabell says. A sixteen-year-old girl with silver hair and silver eyes, she has been sixteen for thirty-five years; no time passes in Death's Domain. Her encounter with Rincewind is flamboyant enough to make him believe she is 'bonkers'.
