excerpt: >-
  **Ghenghiz Cohen**, known as Cohen the Barbarian, is a hero in the classical sense, i.e., a professional thief, brawler and ravisher of women. Cohen is introduced in the second Discworld novel, [The Light Fantastic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Light_Fantastic/), with significant returns in [Interesting Times](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interesting_Times/) and then with his last appearance in [The Last Hero](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Hero/). His name and character are an obvious echo of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian and Genghis Khan, and of the common Jewish surname Cohen.
