excerpt: >-
  **Death** is a fictional character in [Terry Pratchett](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett/)'s *[Discworld](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld/)* series and a parody of several other personifications of death. Like most Grim Reapers, he is a black-robed skeleton who usually carries a scythe. His jurisdiction is specifically the Discworld itself; he is only a part, or minion, of Azrael: the universal Death. He has been generally used by Pratchett to explore the problems of human existence, and has become more sympathetic throughout the series.
