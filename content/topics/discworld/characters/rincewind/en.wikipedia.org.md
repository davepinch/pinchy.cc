excerpt: >-
  **Rincewind** is a fictional character appearing in several of the *[Discworld](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld/)* novels by [Terry Pratchett](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett/). He is a failed student at the Unseen University for wizards in Ankh-Morpork, and is often described by scholars as "the magical equivalent to the number zero". He spends most of his time running away from bands of people who want to kill him for various reasons. The fact that he's still alive and running is explained in that, although he was born with a wizard's spirit, he has the body of a long-distance sprinter. Rincewind is also renowned for being able to solve minor problems by turning them into major disasters. His unique "skill" is implied to be due to being the chosen one of "The Lady", the anthropomorphic personification of luck (both good and bad).
