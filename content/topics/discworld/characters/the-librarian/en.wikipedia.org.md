character of: Discworld (Wikipedia)
excerpt: >-
  The **Librarian** appeared in the second novel of the series, [The Light Fantastic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Light_Fantastic/), where he was transformed into an [orang-utan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orangutan). This had certain advantages for a librarian, such as being able to use his hands and feet for re-shelving books. The other wizards have gradually become used to the situation, to the extent that, from Night Watch: "if someone ever reported that there was an orang-utan in the Library, the wizards would probably go and ask the Librarian if he'd seen it."
