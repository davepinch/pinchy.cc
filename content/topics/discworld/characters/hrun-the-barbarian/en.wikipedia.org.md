excerpt: >-
  In the first Discworld novel, [The Colour of Magic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Colour_of_Magic/), Hrun appears as an archetypal fantasy barbarian: hulking and muscle-bound yet slow-witted, battle-prone, alcoholic, and fond of virgins. Hrun stole his magical talking sword, Kring, after a battle, but regrets it due to the sword's talkativeness.
