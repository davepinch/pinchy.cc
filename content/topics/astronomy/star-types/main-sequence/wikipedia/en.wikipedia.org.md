excerpt: >-
  In astronomy, the **main sequence** is a classification of stars which appear on plots of stellar color versus brightness as a continuous and distinctive band. Stars on this band are known as main-sequence stars or dwarf stars, and positions of stars on and off the band are believed to indicate their physical properties, as well as their progress through several types of star life-cycles. These are the most numerous true stars in the universe and include the Sun. Color-magnitude plots are known as Hertzsprungâ€“Russell diagrams after Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell.
