excerpt: >-
  An **A-type main-sequence star** (AV) or A **dwarf star** is a main-sequence (hydrogen burning) star of spectral type A and luminosity class V (five). These stars have spectra defined by strong hydrogen Balmer absorption lines. They measure between 1.4 and 2.1 solar masses (Mâ˜‰) and have surface temperatures between 7,600 and 10,000 K. Bright and nearby examples are [Altair](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair/) (A7), Sirius A (A1), and [Vega](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vega/) (A0). A-type stars do not have convective zones and thus are not expected to harbor magnetic dynamos. As a consequence, because they do not have strong stellar winds, they lack a means to generate X-ray emissions.
