excerpt: >-
  A **star system** or **stellar system** is a small number of stars that orbit each other, bound by gravitational attraction. A large group of stars bound by gravitation is generally called a *star cluster* or *galaxy*, although, broadly speaking, they are also star systems. Star systems are not to be confused with planetary systems, which include planets and similar bodies (such as comets).
