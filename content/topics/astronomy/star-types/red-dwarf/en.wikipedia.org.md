excerpt: >-
  A **red dwarf** is the smallest kind of star on the main sequence. Red dwarfs are by far the most common type of fusing star in the [Milky Way](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way/), at least in the neighborhood of the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun/). However, due to their low luminosity, individual red dwarfs cannot be easily observed. From [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/), not one star that fits the stricter definitions of a red dwarf is visible to the naked eye. [Proxima Centauri](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri/), the star nearest to the Sun, is a red dwarf, as are fifty of the sixty nearest stars. According to some estimates, red dwarfs make up three-quarters of the fusing stars in the Milky Way.
