excerpt: >-
  **Red supergiants** (**RSGs**) are stars with a supergiant luminosity class (Yerkes class I) and a stellar classification K or M. They are the largest stars in the universe in terms of volume, although they are not the most massive or luminous. [Betelgeuse](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betelgeuse/) and Antares A are the brightest and best known red supergiants (RSGs), indeed the only first magnitude red supergiant stars.
