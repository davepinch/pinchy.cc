  **Delta Cephei** (δ Cep, δ Cephei) is a quadruple star system located approximately 887 light-years away in the northern constellation of Cepheus, the King. At this distance, the visual magnitude of the star is diminished by 0.23 as a result of extinction caused by gas and dust along the line of sight.[6] It is the prototype of the Cepheid variable stars that undergo periodic changes in luminosity.
