  **Pollux** is the brightest star in the constellation of Gemini. It has the Bayer designation **β Geminorum**, which is Latinised to **Beta Geminorum** and abbreviated **Beta Gem** or **β Gem**. This is an orange-hued, evolved red giant located at a distance of 34 light-years, making it the closest red giant (and giant star) to the Sun. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. In 2006 an exoplanet (designated Pollux b or β Geminorum b, later named Thestias) was announced to be orbiting it.
