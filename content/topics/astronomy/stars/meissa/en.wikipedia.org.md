  **Meissa** /ˈmaɪsə/, designated **Lambda Orionis** (**λ Orionis**, abbreviated **Lambda Ori**, **λ Ori**) is a star in the constellation of [Orion](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation)/). It is a multiple star approximately 1,300 ly away with a combined apparent magnitude of 3.33. The main components are an O8 giant star and a B-class main sequence star, separated by about 4″. Despite Meissa being more luminous and only slightly further away than Rigel, it appears 3 magnitudes dimmer at visual wavelengths, with much of its radiation emitted in the ultraviolet due to its high temperature.
