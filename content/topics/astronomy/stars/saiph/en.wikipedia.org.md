excerpt: >-
  **Saiph** /ˈseɪf/, designation **Kappa Orionis** (**κ Orionis**, abbreviated **Kappa Ori**, **κ Ori**) and **53 Orionis** (**53 Ori**), is the sixth-brightest star in the constellation of [Orion](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation)/). Of the four bright stars that compose Orion's main quadrangle, it is the star at the south-eastern corner. A northern-hemisphere observer facing south would see it at the lower left of Orion, and a southern-hemisphere observer facing north would see it at the upper right. Parallax measurements yield an estimated distance of 650 light-years (200 parsecs) from the Sun, which is about the same as [Betelgeuse](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betelgeuse/). It is smaller, less luminous but hotter at its surface than [Rigel](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigel/) with an apparent visual magnitude of 2.1. The luminosity of this star changes slightly, varying by 0.04 magnitudes.
