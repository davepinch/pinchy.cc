  **Regulus** is the brightest object in the constellation [Leo](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_(constellation)/) and one of the brightest stars in the night sky. It has the Bayer designation designated α Leonis, which is Latinized to Alpha Leonis, and abbreviated Alpha Leo or α Leo. Regulus appears singular, but is actually a quadruple star system composed of four stars that are organized into two pairs. The spectroscopic binary Regulus A consists of a blue-white main-sequence star and its companion, which has not yet been directly observed, but is probably a white dwarf. The system lies approximately 79 light years from the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun/).
