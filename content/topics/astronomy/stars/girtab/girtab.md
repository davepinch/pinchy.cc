title: "Girtab"
alternate name of: Sargas
note: There seems to be some confusion regarding this name. Jim Kaler of STARS says Girtab refers to Theta Scorpii. This is also indicated in the sidebar of the Theta Scorpii Wikipedia article. However, Wikipedia also says Girtab refers to Kappa Scorpii.
TODO: investigate Girtab nomenclature
