  **Sirius** is the brightest star in the night sky. Its name is derived from the Greek word Σείριος (Latin script: *Seirios*), meaning lit. 'glowing' or 'scorching'. The star is designated **α Canis Majoris**, Latinized to **Alpha Canis Majoris**, and abbreviated **α CMa** or **Alpha CMa**. With a visual apparent magnitude of −1.46, Sirius is almost twice as bright as Canopus, the next brightest star. Sirius is a binary star consisting of a main-sequence star of spectral type A0 or A1, termed Sirius A, and a faint white dwarf companion of spectral type DA2, termed Sirius B. The distance between the two varies between 8.2 and 31.5 astronomical units as they orbit every 50 years.
