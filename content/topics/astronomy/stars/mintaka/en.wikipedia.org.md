  **Mintaka** /ˈmɪntəkə/, designation **Delta Orionis** (**δ Orionis**, abbreviated **Delta Ori**, **δ Ori**) and **34 Orionis** (**34 Ori**), is a multiple [star system](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_system/) some 1,200 light-years from the Sun in the constellation of [Orion](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation)/). Together with [Alnitak](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alnitak/) (Zeta Orionis) and [Alnilam](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alnilam/) (Epsilon Orionis), the three stars form Orion's Belt, known by many names among ancient cultures. The star is located very close to the celestial equator. When Orion is near the meridian, Mintaka is the rightmost of the Belt's stars when viewed from the Northern Hemisphere facing south.
