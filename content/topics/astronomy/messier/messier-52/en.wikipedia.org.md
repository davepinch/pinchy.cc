  **Messier 52** or **M52**, also known as **NGC 7654** or the **Scorpion Cluster**, is an open cluster of stars in the highly northern constellation of [Cassiopeia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_(constellation)/). It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1774. It can be seen from [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/) under a good night sky with binoculars. The brightness of the cluster is influenced by extinction, which is stronger in the southern half. Its metallicity is somewhat below that of the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun/), and is estimated to be [Fe/H] = −0.05 ± 0.01.
