  **NGC 6231** (also known as **Caldwell 76** or the **Baby Scorpion Cluster**) is an open cluster in the southern sky located half a degrees north of Zeta Scorpii. NGC 6231 is part of a swath of young, bluish stars in the constellation [Scorpius](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpius/) known as the Scorpius OB1 association. The star Zeta1 (HR 6262) is a member of this association, while its brighter apparent partner, Zeta2 (HR 6271), is only 150 ly from [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/) and so is not a member.
