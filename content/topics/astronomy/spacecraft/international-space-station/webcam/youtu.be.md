  Live views from the International Space Station are streaming from an external camera mounted on the station's Harmony module. \ The camera is looking forward at an angle so that International Docking Adapter 2 is visible. If the Harmony module camera is not available due to operational considerations for a longer period of time, a continuous loop of recorded Earth views will be displayed with the caption “Previously Recorded.”
