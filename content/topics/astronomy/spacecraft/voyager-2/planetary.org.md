excerpt: >-
  Bruce C. Murray served as the only geologist on the team planning the Grand Tour, which was cancelled by NASA in 1972, but which led to Voyager the same year. He later became the Director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), a position he held from 1976 to 1982, the early glory years of the mission. While leading JPL, he co-founded The Planetary Society with Carl Sagan, and currently serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors. He is now an emeritus professor of geology and planetary sciences at the California Institute of Technology.
