excerpt: >-
  The **initial singularity** is a singularity predicted by some models of the [Big Bang theory](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang/) to have existed before the Big Bang. The instant immediately following the initial singularity is part of the Planck epoch, the earliest period of time in the history of our universe.
