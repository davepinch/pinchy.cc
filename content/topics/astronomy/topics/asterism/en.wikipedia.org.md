excerpt: >-
  An **asterism** is an observed pattern or group of stars in the sky. Asterisms can be any identified pattern or group of stars, and therefore are a more general concept than the 88 formally defined constellations. Constellations are based on asterisms, but unlike asterisms, constellations outline and today completely divide the sky and all its celestial objects into regions around their central asterisms. For example, the asterism known as the [Big Dipper](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dipper) comprises the seven brightest stars in the constellation [Ursa Major](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major). Another is the asterism of the Southern Cross, within the constellation of Crux.
