  ***Urania's Mirror; or, a view of the Heavens*** is a set of 32 astronomical star chart cards, first published in November 1824. They are illustrations based on Alexander Jamieson's *A Celestial Atlas,* but the addition of holes punched in them allow them to be held up to a light to see a depiction of the constellation's stars. They were engraved by Sidney Hall, and were said to be designed by "a lady", but have since been identified as the work of the Reverend Richard Rouse Bloxam, an assistant master at Rugby School.
