excerpt: >-
  **Astronomy** is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It uses mathematics, [physics](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics), and [chemistry](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry/) in order to explain their origin and evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, meteoroids, asteroids, and comets. Relevant phenomena include supernova explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates beyond [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth)'s atmosphere. Cosmology is a branch of astronomy that studies the universe as a whole.
