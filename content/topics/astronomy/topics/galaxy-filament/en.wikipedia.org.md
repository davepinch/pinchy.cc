excerpt: >-
  In cosmology, **galaxy filaments** are the largest known structures in the universe, consisting of 'walls' of gravitationally bound galactic superclusters. These massive, thread-like formations can reach 80 megaparsecs hâˆ’1 (or of the order of 160 to 260 million light-years) and form the boundaries between voids. Galaxy filaments form the cosmic web and define the overall structure of the observable universe.
