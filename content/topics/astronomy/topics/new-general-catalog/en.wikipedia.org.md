excerpt: >-
  The ***New General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars*** (abbreviated **NGC**) is an astronomical catalogue of deep-sky objects compiled by John Louis Emil Dreyer in 1888. The NGC contains 7,840 objects, including galaxies, star clusters and emission nebulae. Dreyer published two supplements to the NGC in 1895 and 1908, known as the ***Index Catalogues*** (abbreviated **IC**), describing a further 5,386 astronomical objects. Thousands of these objects are best known by their NGC or IC numbers, which remain in widespread use.
