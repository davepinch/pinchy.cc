excerpt: >-
  Young associations will contain 10 to 100 massive stars of spectral class O and B, and are known as *OB associations*. In addition, these associations also contain hundreds or thousands of low- and intermediate-mass stars. Association members are believed to form within the same small volume inside a giant molecular cloud. Once the surrounding dust and gas is blown away, the remaining stars become unbound and begin to drift apart.
