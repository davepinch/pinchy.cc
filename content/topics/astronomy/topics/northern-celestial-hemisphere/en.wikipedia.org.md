excerpt: >-
  The **northern celestial hemisphere**, also called the **Northern Sky**, is the northern half of the celestial sphere; that is, it lies north of the celestial equator. This arbitrary sphere appears to rotate westward around a polar axis due to [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/)'s rotation.
