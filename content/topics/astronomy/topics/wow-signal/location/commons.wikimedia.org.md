  A general map of the location where the Wow! signal supposedly originated. Two small areas of the sky in the constellation Sagittarius are depicted as the areas of uncertainty from which the source of the Wow! signal originates. The signal, which was heard by the Ohio State University Radio Observatory, lasted 72 seconds and is to date the most likely candidate for extraterrestrial contact, as no terrestrial or natural origin for the signal has been reliably proven yet. This map was originally drawn by Benjamin Crowell (Fashionslide), using data from yoursky, a Fourmilab Switzerland project.
