excerpt: >-
  The **heat death of the universe** (also known as the **Big Chill** or **Big Freeze**) is a hypothesis on the ultimate fate of the [universe]([universe](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe)), which suggests the universe will evolve to a state of no thermodynamic free energy, and will therefore be unable to sustain processes that increase entropy. Heat death does not imply any particular absolute temperature; it only requires that temperature differences or other processes may no longer be exploited to perform work. In the language of [physics](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics), this is when the universe reaches thermodynamic equilibrium. The Heat Death theory has become the leading theory in the modern age with the fewest unpredictable factors.
