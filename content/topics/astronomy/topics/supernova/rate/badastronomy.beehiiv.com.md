title: "BAN #447: Wait. HOW MANY supernova explode every year? (badastronomy.beehiiv.com)"
excerpt: >-
  I recently wrote about the Cartwheel galaxy, a weird ring-shaped galaxy that suffered a massive collision that gave it its distinctive shape. \ I also mentioned it had a supernova in it, called SN2021 afdx. And I have to say, when I first saw that designation I actually muttered an obscenity or two under my breath.
