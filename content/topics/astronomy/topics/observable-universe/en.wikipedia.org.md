excerpt: >-
  The **observable universe** is a ball-shaped region of the [universe](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe/) comprising all matter that can be observed from [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) or its space-based telescopes and exploratory probes at the present time; the electromagnetic radiation from these objects has had time to reach the [Solar System](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System) and Earth since the beginning of the cosmological expansion. Initially, it was estimated that there may be 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe. That number was reduced in 2021 to only several hundred billion based on data from New Horizons. Assuming the universe is isotropic, the distance to the edge of the observable universe is roughly the same in every direction. That is, the observable universe is a spherical region centered on the observer. Every location in the universe has its own observable universe, which may or may not overlap with the one centered on Earth.
