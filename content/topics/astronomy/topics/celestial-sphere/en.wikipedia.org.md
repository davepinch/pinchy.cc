excerpt: >-
  In astronomy and navigation, the **celestial sphere** is an abstract sphere that has an arbitrarily large radius and is concentric to [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/). All objects in the sky can be conceived as being projected upon the inner surface of the celestial sphere, which may be centered on Earth or the observer. If centered on the observer, half of the sphere would resemble a hemispherical screen over the observing location.
