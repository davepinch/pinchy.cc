    A **solar eclipse** occurs when the [Moon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon) passes between [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) and the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun), thereby obscuring the view of the Sun from a small part of the Earth, totally or partially.

    A **total eclipse** occurs when the dark silhouette of the [Moon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon) completely obscures the intensely bright light of the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun), allowing the much fainter solar corona to be visible. During any one eclipse, totality occurs at best only in a narrow track on the surface of [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth). This narrow track is called the path of totality.

    An **annular eclipse** occurs when the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun) and [Moon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon) are exactly in line with the [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), but the apparent size of the Moon is smaller than that of the Sun. Hence the Sun appears as a very bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.

    A **partial eclipse** occurs when the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun) and [Moon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon) are not exactly in line with the [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) and the Moon only partially obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can usually be seen from a large part of the Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse.
