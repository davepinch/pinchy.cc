excerpt: >-
  **Neptune** is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known planet in the [Solar System](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System/). It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/), and slightly more massive than its near-twin [Uranus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus/). Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The planet orbits the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun/) once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, representing Neptune's trident.
