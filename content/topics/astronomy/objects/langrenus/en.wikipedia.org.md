excerpt: >-
  **Langrenus** is an impact crater located near the eastern [lunar](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon/) limb. The feature is circular in shape, but appears oblong due to foreshortening. It lies on the eastern shore of the Mare Fecunditatis. To the south is the overlapping crater pair Vendelinus and the smaller Lamé.
