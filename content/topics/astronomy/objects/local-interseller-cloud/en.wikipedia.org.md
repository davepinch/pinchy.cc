    The Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC), also known as the Local Fluff, is an interstellar cloud roughly 30 light-years (9.2 pc) across, through which the [Solar System](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System) is moving.

    It is unknown whether the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun) is embedded in the Local Interstellar Cloud, or is in the region where the Local Interstellar Cloud is interacting with the neighboring G-Cloud.

    The [Solar System](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System) is located within a structure called the [Local Bubble](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Bubble), a low-density region of the galactic interstellar medium. Within this region is the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC), an area of slightly higher hydrogen density.

    It is estimated that the [Solar System]([Solar System](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System)) entered the LIC within the past 10,000 years.

    A recent analysis estimates the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun) will completely exit the LIC in no more than 1,900 years.

    The cloud has a temperature of about 7,000 K (7,000 °C; 12,000 °F), about the same temperature as the surface of the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun). However, its specific heat capacity is very low because it is not very dense, with 0.3 atoms per cubic centimetre (5/cu in).
