title: "Laniakea - Space visualization fly-through (youtube.com)"
episode of: "https://www.youtube.com/@DeepSkytv"
excerpt: >-
  Deep Sky recently produced several space visualization animations for Burmer Music and Composition Lab. One of the sequences was visualizing our neighborhood of 100,000 galaxies; Laniakea. We worked closely with astrophysicist Daniel Pomarede, IRFU-CEA, Paris to utilized real data of the galaxy super cluster. Daniel provided and translated data into vertice points within an OBJ. Programming was needed to properly visualize Laniakeaâ€™s galaxy paths (streamlines) since neither 3D Max, Maya and Cinema 4D could properly translate the data. Blender and After Effects worked well communicating and properly visualizing the star cluster galaxies, streamlines, animation and compositing. Additional script work was used to share camera information between Blender and After Effects.
