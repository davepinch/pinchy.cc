  **Deneb** (/ˈdɛnɛb/) is a first-magnitude star in the constellation of [Cygnus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_(constellation)). Deneb is one of the vertices of the asterism known as the [Summer Triangle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Triangle) and the "head" of the Northern Cross. It is the brightest star in Cygnus and the 19th brightest star in the night sky, with an average apparent magnitude of +1.25. A blue-white supergiant, Deneb rivals Rigel as the most luminous first-magnitude star. However, its distance, and hence luminosity, is poorly known; its luminosity is somewhere between 55,000 and 196,000 times that of the Sun. Its Bayer designation is α Cygni, which is Latinised to Alpha Cygni, abbreviated to Alpha Cyg or α Cyg.
