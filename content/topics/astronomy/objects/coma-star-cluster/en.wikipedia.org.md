excerpt: >-
  The **Coma Star Cluster** (also known as **Melotte 111** or **Collinder 256**) is a small but nearby open cluster located in the constellation [Coma Berenices](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_Berenices/). The cluster contains about 40 brighter stars (between magnitudes 5 and 10) with a common proper motion. The brighter stars of the cluster make out a distinctive "V" shape as seen when Coma Berenices is rising. The cluster used to represent the tail of [Leo](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_(constellation)/). However, in around 240 BC, Ptolemy III renamed it for the Egyptian queen Berenice's legendary sacrifice of her hair.
