The **Galactic Center** is the rotational center, the barycenter, of the [Milky Way](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) galaxy. Its central massive object is a supermassive black hole of about 4 million solar masses, which is called Sagittarius A*, a compact radio source which is almost exactly at the galactic rotational center. The Galactic Center is approximately 8 kiloparsecs (26,000 ly) away from [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) in the direction of the constellations [Sagittarius](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(constellation)), [Ophiuchus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiuchus), and [Scorpius](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpius), where the Milky Way appears brightest, visually close to the Butterfly Cluster (M6) or the star Shaula, south to the Pipe Nebula.
