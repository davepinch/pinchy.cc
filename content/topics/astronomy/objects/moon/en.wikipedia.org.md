excerpt: >-
  The **Moon** is [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/)'s only natural satellite. Its diameter is about one-quarter of Earth's (comparable to the width of [Australia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia/)), making it the fifth largest satellite in the [Solar System](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System/) and the largest and most massive relative to its parent planet. It is larger than all known dwarf planets in the Solar System. The Moon is a planetary-mass object with a differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term. It lacks any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's at 0.1654 g—[Jupiter](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter/)'s moon Io is the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.
