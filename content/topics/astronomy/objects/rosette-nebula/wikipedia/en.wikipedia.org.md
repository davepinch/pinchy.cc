  The **Rosette Nebula** (also known as **Caldwell 49**) is an H II region located near one end of a giant molecular cloud in the [Monoceros](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoceros/) region of the [Milky Way Galaxy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way/). The open cluster NGC 2244 (Caldwell 50) is closely associated with the nebulosity, the stars of the cluster having been formed from the nebula's matter.
