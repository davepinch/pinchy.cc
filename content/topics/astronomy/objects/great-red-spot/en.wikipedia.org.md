excerpt: >-
  The **Great Red Spot** is a persistent high-pressure region in the atmosphere of [Jupiter](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter/), producing an anticyclonic storm that is the largest in the [Solar System](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System/). It is the most recognizable feature on Jupiter, owing to its red-orange color whose origin is still unknown. Located 22 degrees south of Jupiter's equator, it produces wind-speeds up to 432 km/h (268 mph). Observations from 1665 to 1713 are believed to be of the same storm; if this is correct, it has existed for at least 358 years. It was next observed in September 1831, with 60 recorded observations between then and 1878, when continuous observations began.
