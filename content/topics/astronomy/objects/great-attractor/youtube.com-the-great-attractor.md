excerpt: >-
  No matter where you are, you are always moving. The Earth orbits the sun, and the sun moves round the galaxy. But what is it that makes the galaxy move? That is going to be our topic today. Everything in our local galaxy supercluster, Laniakea, is being dragged towards a very high concentration of mass hidden behind the plane of our galaxy. It has all the ingredients for an epic space mystery, it is the Great Attractor.
