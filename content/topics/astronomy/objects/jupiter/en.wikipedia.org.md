  **Jupiter** is the fifth planet from the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun) and the largest in the [Solar System](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System). It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and slightly less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth)'s night sky after the [Moon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon) and [Venus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus), and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named after [Jupiter](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_(mythology)), the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.
