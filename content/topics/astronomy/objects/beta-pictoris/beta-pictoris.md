title: "Beta Pictoris"
constellation: Pictor
TODO: Look at Beta Pictoris and send me a description or picture. An exoplanet orbits this star; in fact, the first exoplanet determined optically. While you cannot see the exoplanet with your eye or consumer telescope equipment, it is quite possible you will capture a few photons in your eye or camera.
