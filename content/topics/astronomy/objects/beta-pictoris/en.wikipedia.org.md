  **Beta Pictoris** (abbreviated **β Pictoris** or **β Pic**) is the second brightest star in the constellation [Pictor](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictor/). It is located 63.4 light-years (19.4 pc) from the [Solar System](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System/), and is 1.75 times as massive and 8.7 times as luminous as the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun/). The Beta Pictoris system is very young, only 20 to 26 million years old, although it is already in the main sequence stage of its evolution. Beta Pictoris is the title member of the Beta Pictoris moving group, an association of young stars which share the same motion through space and have the same age.
