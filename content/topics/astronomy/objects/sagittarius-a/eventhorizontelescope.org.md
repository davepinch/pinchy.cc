title: "Astronomers Unveil Strong Magnetic Fields Spiraling at the Edge of Milky Wayâ€™s Central Black Hole (eventhorizontelescope.org)"
excerpt: >-
  A new image from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration has uncovered strong and organized magnetic fields spiraling from the edge of the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Seen in polarized light for the first time, this new view of the monster lurking at the heart of the Milky Way Galaxy has revealed a magnetic field structure strikingly similar to that of the black hole at the center of the M87 galaxy, suggesting that strong magnetic fields may be common to all black holes. This similarity also hints toward a hidden jet in Sgr A*. The results were published today in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.
TODO:
  - Move to Sgr*
  - Link to picture on this article (find source image)
