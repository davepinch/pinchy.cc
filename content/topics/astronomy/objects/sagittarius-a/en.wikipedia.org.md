excerpt: >-
  **Sagittarius A** (**Sgr A**) is a complex radio source at the center of the [Milky Way](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way/), which contains a supermassive black hole. It is located in the constellation [Sagittarius](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(constellation)/), and is hidden from view at optical wavelengths by large clouds of cosmic dust in the spiral arms of the Milky Way. The dust lane that obscures the Galactic Center from a vantage point around the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun/) causes the Great Rift through the bright bulge of the galaxy.
