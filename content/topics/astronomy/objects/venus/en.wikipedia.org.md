excerpt: >-
  **Venus** is the second planet from the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun/). It is a rocky planet with the densest atmosphere of all the rocky bodies in the [Solar System](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System/), and the only one with a mass and size that is close to that of its orbital neighbour [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/). Orbiting inferiorly (inside of Earth's orbit), it appears in Earth's sky always close to the Sun, as either a "morning star" or an "evening star". While this is also true for [Mercury](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)/), Venus appears much more prominently, since it is the third brightest object in Earth's sky after the [Moon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon/) and the Sun, appearing brighter than any other star-like classical planet or any fixed star. With such a prominence in Earth's sky, Venus has historically been a common and important object for humans, in both their cultures and astronomy.
