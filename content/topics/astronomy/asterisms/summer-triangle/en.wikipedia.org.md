excerpt: >-
  The Summer Triangle is an astronomical asterism in the [northern celestial hemisphere](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_celestial_hemisphere/). The defining vertices of this imaginary triangle are at [Altair](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair/), [Deneb](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deneb/), and [Vega](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vega/), each of which is the brightest star of its constellation ([Aquila](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquila_(constellation)/), [Cygnus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_(constellation)/), and [Lyra](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyra/), respectively). The greatest declination is +45° and lowest is +9° meaning the three can be seen from all places in the Northern Hemisphere and from the home of most people resident in the Southern Hemisphere. The two stars in [Aquila](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquila_(constellation)/) and [Cygnus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_(constellation)/) represent the head of an eagle and tail of a swan that looks east inscribed into the triangle and forming the altitude of the triangle. Two small constellations, [Sagitta](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagitta/) and [Vulpecula](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulpecula/), lie between Aquila in the south of the triangle and Cygnus and Lyra to the north.
