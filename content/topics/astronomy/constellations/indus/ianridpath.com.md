  Indus is one of the 12 figures formed by the Dutch navigators Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman from stars they charted in the southern hemisphere on their voyages to the East Indies at the end of the 16th century. It was first shown in 1598 on a globe by the Dutch cartographer Petrus Plancius and first appeared in print in 1603 on the *Uranometria* atlas of Johann Bayer.
