  **Ursa Minor** (Latin: 'Lesser Bear', contrasting with Ursa Major), also known as the **Little Bear**, is a constellation located in the far [northern sky](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_celestial_hemisphere/). As with the Great Bear, the tail of the Little Bear may also be seen as the handle of a ladle, hence the North American name, **Little Dipper**: seven stars with four in its bowl like its partner the [Big Dipper](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dipper/). Ursa Minor was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer [Ptolemy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy/), and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Ursa Minor has traditionally been important for navigation, particularly by mariners, because of [Polaris](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris/) being the north pole star.
