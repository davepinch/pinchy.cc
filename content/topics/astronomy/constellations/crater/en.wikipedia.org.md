  **Crater** is a small constellation in the [southern celestial hemisphere](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_celestial_hemisphere/). Its name is the latinization of the Greek krater, a type of cup used to water down wine. One of the 48 constellations listed by the second-century astronomer [Ptolemy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy/), it depicts a cup that has been associated with the god Apollo and is perched on the back of [Hydra](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_(constellation)/) the water snake.
