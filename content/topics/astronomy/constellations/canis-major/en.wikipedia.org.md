excerpt: >-
  **Canis Major** is a constellation in the southern celestial hemisphere. In the second century, it was included in [Ptolemy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy/)'s 48 constellations, and is counted among the 88 modern constellations. Its name is Latin for "greater dog" in contrast to [Canis Minor](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis_Minor/), the "lesser dog"; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of [Orion](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation)/) the hunter through the sky. The [Milky Way](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way/) passes through Canis Major and several open clusters lie within its borders, most notably M41.
