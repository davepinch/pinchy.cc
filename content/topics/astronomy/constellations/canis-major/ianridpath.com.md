excerpt: >-
  Four dogs are to be found among the constellations: Canis Major, Canis Minor, and the two hunting dogs of Canes Venatici, but Canis Major is undoubtedly the top dog. Indeed, Ptolemy in the *Almagest* called it simply Κύων (Kyon), the Dog. Canis Major is dominated by Sirius, popularly termed the Dog Star, the most brilliant star in the entire night sky; almost certainly the constellation originated with this star alone.
