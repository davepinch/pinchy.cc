excerpt: >-
  **Corona Australis** is a constellation in the [Southern Celestial Hemisphere](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_celestial_hemisphere/). Its Latin name means "southern crown", and it is the southern counterpart of [Corona Borealis](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona_Borealis/), the northern crown. It is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer [Ptolemy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy/), and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. The Ancient Greeks saw Corona Australis as a wreath rather than a crown and associated it with [Sagittarius](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(constellation)/) or [Centaurus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaurus/). Other cultures have likened the pattern to a turtle, ostrich nest, a tent, or even a hut belonging to a rock hyrax.
