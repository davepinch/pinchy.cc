excerpt: >-
  Corona Australis was known to the Greeks not as a crown but as a wreath, which is how it is depicted on old star maps. Aratus did not name it as a separate constellation but referred to it simply as a circlet of stars beneath the forefeet of Sagittarius. Hyginus said it was a wreath cast off by the archer ‘as by one at play’.
