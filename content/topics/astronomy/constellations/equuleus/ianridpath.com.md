excerpt: >-
  This insignificant constellation, second-smallest in the sky, was one of the 48 constellations listed by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the second century AD. It was unknown to Aratus 400 years earlier, and its invention is often attributed to Ptolemy. In the *Almagest* he called it Ἵππου Προτομή (Hippou Protome), the forepart of a horse; Equuleus is a later Latin name.
