excerpt: >-
  **Puppis** /ˈpʌpɪs/ is a constellation in the [southern sky](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_celestial_hemisphere/). Puppis, the Poop Deck, was originally part of an over-large constellation Argo Navis (the ship of Jason and the Argonauts), which centuries after its initial description, was divided into three parts, the other two being Carina (the keel and hull), and Vela (the sails of the ship). Puppis is the largest of the three constellations in square degrees. It is one of the 88 modern constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union.
