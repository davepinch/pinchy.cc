excerpt: >-
  The largest of the three sections into which the ancient constellation of Argo Navis, the ship of the Argonauts, was divided by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in his catalogue of the southern stars published in 1756. In that catalogue he gave it the French name *Pouppe du Navire*. His final catalogue, *Coelum australe stelliferum*, appeared in 1763 containing the same subdivisions but with Latin rather than French names.
