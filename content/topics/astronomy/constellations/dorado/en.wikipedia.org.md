excerpt: >-
  **Dorado** (US: /dɒˈreɪdoʊ, /also UK: /-ɑːdoʊ/) is a constellation in the southern sky. It was named in the late 16th century and is now one of the 88 modern constellations. Its name refers to the dolphinfish (*Coryphaena hippurus*), which is known as *dorado* in Spanish, although it has also been depicted as a swordfish. Dorado contains most of the Large Magellanic Cloud, the remainder being in the constellation Mensa. The South Ecliptic pole also lies within this constellation.
