excerpt: >-
  **Triangulum Australe** is a small constellation in the far [Southern Celestial Hemisphere](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_celestial_hemisphere/). Its name is Latin for "the southern triangle", which distinguishes it from [Triangulum](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulum/) in the northern sky and is derived from the acute, almost equilateral pattern of its three brightest stars. It was first depicted on a celestial globe as Triangulus Antarcticus by Petrus Plancius in 1589, and later with more accuracy and its current name by Johann Bayer in his 1603 *Uranometria*. The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted and gave the brighter stars their Bayer designations in 1756.
