  **Ursa Major** (/ˈɜːrsə ˈmeɪdʒər/; also known as the **Great Bear**) is a constellation in the northern sky, whose associated mythology likely dates back into prehistory. Its Latin name means "greater (or larger) bear", referring to and contrasting it with nearby [Ursa Minor](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Minor), the lesser bear. In antiquity, it was one of the original 48 constellations listed by [Ptolemy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy) in the 2nd century AD, drawing on earlier works by Greek, Egyptian, Babylonian, and Assyrian astronomers. Today it is the third largest of the 88 modern constellations.
