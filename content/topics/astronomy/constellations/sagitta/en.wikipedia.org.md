excerpt: >-
  **Sagitta** is a dim but distinctive constellation in the [northern sky](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_celestial_hemisphere/). Its name is Latin for 'arrow', not to be confused with the significantly larger constellation [Sagittarius](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(constellation)/) 'the archer'. It was included among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer [Ptolemy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy/), and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union. Although it dates to antiquity, Sagitta has no star brighter than 3rd magnitude and has the third-smallest area of any constellation.
