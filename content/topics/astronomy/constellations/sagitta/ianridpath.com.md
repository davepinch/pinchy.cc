excerpt: >-
  Sagitta, the third-smallest constellation in the sky, has no stars brighter than fourth magnitude, but it was well-known to the Greeks and was among the 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy in the *Almagest*. Aratus described it as ‘alone, without a bow’ since there is no sign of the archer who might have shot it.
