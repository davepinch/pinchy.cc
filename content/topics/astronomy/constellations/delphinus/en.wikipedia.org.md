  **Delphinus** (Pronounced /dɛlˈfaɪnəs/ or /ˈdɛlfɪnəs/) is a small constellation in the [Northern Celestial Hemisphere](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_celestial_hemisphere/), close to the celestial equator. Its name is the Latin version for the Greek word for dolphin (δελφίς). It is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [Ptolemy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy/), and remains one of the 88 modern constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union. It is one of the smaller constellations, ranked 69th in size. Delphinus' five brightest stars form a distinctive asterism symbolizing a dolphin with four stars representing the body and one the tail. It is bordered (clockwise from north) by [Vulpecula](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulpecula/), [Sagitta](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagitta/), [Aquila](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquila_(constellation)/), [Aquarius](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarius_(constellation)/), [Equuleus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equuleus/) and [Pegasus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_(constellation)/).
