  The planet Neptune was discovered by German astronomer Johann Galle, near Deneb Algedi (Î´ Capricorni) on 23 September 1846, as Capricornus can be seen best from Europe at 4:00am in September (although, by modern constellation boundaries established in the early 20th century CE, Neptune lay within the confines of Aquarius at the time of its discovery).
