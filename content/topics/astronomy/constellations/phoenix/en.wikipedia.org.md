excerpt: >-
  **Phoenix** is a minor constellation in the [southern sky](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_celestial_hemisphere/). Named after the mythical phoenix, it was first depicted on a celestial atlas by Johann Bayer in his 1603 Uranometria. The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted the brighter stars and gave their Bayer designations in 1756. The constellation stretches from roughly −39° to −57° declination, and from 23.5h to 2.5h of right ascension. The constellations Phoenix, [Grus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grus_(constellation)/), [Pavo](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavo_(constellation)/) and [Tucana](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucana/), are known as the Southern Birds.
