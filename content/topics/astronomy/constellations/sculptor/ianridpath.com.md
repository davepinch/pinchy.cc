excerpt: >-
  A faint constellation south of Cetus and Aquarius, invented by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille during his mapping of the southern skies in 1751–52. His original name for it, given on his planisphere of 1756, was *l’Atelier du Sculpteur*, the sculptor’s studio, although in the accompanying star catalogue he spelled (or mis-spelled) the first part of the name as ‘*attelier*’. As described by Lacaille, it consisted of a carved head on a three-legged table, with the artist’s mallet and a chisel on a block of marble next to it (although his illustration actually showed two chisels). On Lacaille’s 1763 planisphere the title was Latinized to Apparatus Sculptoris.
