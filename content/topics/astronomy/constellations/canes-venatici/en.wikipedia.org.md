  **Canes Venatici** (/ˈkeɪniːz vɪˈnætɪsaɪ/) is one of the 88 constellations designated by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It is a small northern constellation that was created by Johannes Hevelius in the 17th century. Its name is Latin for 'hunting dogs', and the constellation is often depicted in illustrations as representing the dogs of [Boötes](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boötes/) the Herdsman, a neighboring constellation.
