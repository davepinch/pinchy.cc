excerpt: >-
  **Pictor** is a constellation in the [Southern Celestial Hemisphere](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_celestial_hemisphere/), located between the star Canopus and the Large Magellanic Cloud. Its name is Latin for painter, and is an abbreviation of the older name Equuleus Pictoris (the "painter's easel"). Normally represented as an easel, Pictor was named by Abb√© Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille in the 18th century. The constellation's brightest star is Alpha Pictoris, a white main-sequence star around 97 light-years away from [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/). Pictor also hosts RR Pictoris, a cataclysmic variable star system that flared up as a nova, reaching apparent (visual) magnitude 1.2 in 1925 before fading into obscurity.
