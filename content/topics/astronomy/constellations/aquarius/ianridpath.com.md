excerpt: >-
  Star maps show Aquarius as a young man pouring water from a jar or amphora, although Ovid, in his *Fasti*, says the liquid is a mixture of water and nectar, the drink of the gods. The water jar is marked by a Y-shaped asterism of four stars centred on 4th-magnitude Zeta Aquarii, and the stream ends in the mouth of the Southern Fish, Piscis Austrinus. Who is this young man commemorated as Aquarius?
