excerpt: >-
  **Aquarius** is an equatorial constellation of the zodiac, between [Capricornus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capricornus/) and [Pisces](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisces_(constellation)/). Its name is Latin for "water-carrier" or "cup-carrier", and its old astronomical symbol is  (♒︎), a representation of water. Aquarius is one of the oldest of the recognized constellations along the zodiac (the Sun's apparent path). It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [Ptolemy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy/), and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is found in a region often called the Sea due to its profusion of constellations with watery associations such as [Cetus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetus/) the whale, Pisces the fish, and [Eridanus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eridanus_(constellation)/) the river.
