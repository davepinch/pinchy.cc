excerpt: >-
  A constellation introduced by the Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius in his star catalogue of 1687. In his *Firmamentum Sobiescianum* star atlas published posthumously in 1690 he depicted it as a double figure of a fox, Vulpecula, carrying in its jaws a goose, Anser. Since then the goose has flown (or been eaten), leaving just the fox.
