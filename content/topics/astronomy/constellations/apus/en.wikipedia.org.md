  **Apus** is a small constellation in the [southern sky](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_celestial_hemisphere/). It represents a [bird-of-paradise](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird-of-paradise/), and its name means "without feet" in Greek because the bird-of-paradise was once wrongly believed to lack feet. First depicted on a celestial globe by Petrus Plancius in 1598, it was charted on a star atlas by Johann Bayer in his 1603 Uranometria. The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted and gave the brighter stars their Bayer designations in 1756.
