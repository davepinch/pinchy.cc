  **Lupus** is a constellation of the mid-[Southern Sky](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_celestial_hemisphere/). Its name is Latin for wolf. Lupus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer [Ptolemy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy/), and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations but was long an asterism associated with the just westerly, larger constellation [Centaurus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaurus/).
