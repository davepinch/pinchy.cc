excerpt: >-
  **Octans** (/ˈɒktænz/) is a faint constellation located in the deep [Southern Sky](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_celestial_hemisphere/). Its name is Latin for the eighth part of a circle, but it is named after the octant, a navigational instrument. Devised by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1752, Octans remains one of the 88 modern constellations. The southern celestial pole is located within the boundaries of Octans.
