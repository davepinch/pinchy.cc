  **Taurus** (Latin for "the Bull") is one of the constellations of the [zodiac](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac/) and is located in the [northern celestial hemisphere](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_celestial_hemisphere/). Taurus is a large and prominent constellation in the Northern Hemisphere's winter sky. It is one of the oldest constellations, dating back to the Early Bronze Age at least, when it marked the location of the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun/) during the spring equinox. Its importance to the agricultural calendar influenced various bull figures in the mythologies of Ancient Sumer, Akkad, Assyria, [Babylon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon/), Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Its old astronomical symbol is  (♉︎), which resembles a bull's head.
