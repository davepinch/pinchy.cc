excerpt: >-
  **Carina** (/kəˈraɪnə, kəˈriːnə/ *kə-RY-nə, -⁠REE-*) is a constellation in the [southern sky](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_celestial_hemisphere/). Its name is Latin for the keel of a ship, and it was the southern foundation of the larger constellation of Argo Navis (the ship Argo) until it was divided into three pieces, the other two being [Puppis](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppis/) (the poop deck), and [Vela](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vela_(constellation)/) (the sails of the ship).
