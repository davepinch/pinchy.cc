excerpt: >-
  **Musca** (Latin for '"the fly"') is a small constellation in the deep southern sky. It was one of 12 constellations created by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, and it first appeared on a celestial globe 35 cm (14 in) in diameter published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer's *Uranometria* of 1603. It was also known as **Apis** (Latin for '"the bee"') for 200 years. Musca remains below the horizon for most Northern Hemisphere observers.
