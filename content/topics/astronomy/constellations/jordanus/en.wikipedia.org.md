title: "Jordanus (constellation)"
excerpt: >-
  **Jordanus** (the *Jordan River*) was a constellation introduced in 1612 (or 1613) on a globe by Petrus Plancius and first shown in print by ‍‍Jakob Bartsch ‍in ‍his ‍book ‍‍Usus *‍Astronomicus ‍Planisphaerii ‍Stellati* ‍(1624). One end lay in the present-day [Canes Venatici](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canes_Venatici/) and then it flowed through the areas now occupied by [Leo Minor](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Minor/) and [Lynx](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(constellation)/), ending near [Camelopardalis](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelopardalis/). This constellation was not adopted in the atlases of Johann Bode and fell into disuse.
