excerpt: >-
  Hydra is the largest of the 88 constellations, winding over a quarter of the way around the sky. Its head is south of the constellation Cancer, the crab, while the tip of its tail lies between Libra, the scales, and Centaurus, the centaur. The total length from its westernmost boundary to the easternmost one is 102°.5. Yet for all its size there is nothing prominent about Hydra. Its only star of note is second-magnitude Alphard, a name that comes from the Arabic al-fard appropriately meaning ‘the solitary one’. Bode on his *Uranographia* atlas gave it the alternative name Unuk es Schudscha, from the Arabic *unuk al-shujā*, neck of the serpent. Both names were originally given by al-Ṣūfī in his *Book of the Fixed Stars* (AD 964).
