excerpt: >-
  One of the 12 new constellations introduced at the end of the 16th century by the Dutch navigators Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. Volans represents a real type of fish found in tropical waters that can leap out of the water and glide through the air on wings. Sometimes the fish landed on the decks of ships and were used for food. In the sky the flying fish is imagined being chased by the predatory Dorado, as happens in reality.
