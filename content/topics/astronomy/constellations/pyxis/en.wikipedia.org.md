excerpt: >-
  **Pyxis** is a small and faint constellation in the [southern sky](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_celestial_hemisphere/). Abbreviated from **Pyxis Nautica**, its name is Latin for a [mariner's compass](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass/) (contrasting with [Circinus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circinus/), which represents a draftsman's compasses). Pyxis was introduced by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille in the 18th century, and is counted among the 88 modern constellations.
