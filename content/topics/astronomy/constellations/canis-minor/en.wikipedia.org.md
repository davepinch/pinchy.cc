excerpt: >-
  **Canis Minor** /ˌkeɪnɪs ˈmaɪnər/ is a small constellation in the [northern celestial hemisphere](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_celestial_hemisphere/). In the second century, it was included as an asterism, or pattern, of two stars in [Ptolemy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy/)'s 48 constellations, and it is counted among the 88 modern constellations. Its name is Latin for "lesser dog", in contrast to [Canis Major](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis_Major/), the "greater dog"; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of [Orion](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation)/) the hunter.
