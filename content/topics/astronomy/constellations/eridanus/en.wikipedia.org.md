excerpt: >-
  **Eridanus** (/ɪˈrɪdənəs/) is a constellation in the [southern celestial hemisphere](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_celestial_hemisphere/). It is represented as a river. One of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [Ptolemy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy/), it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is the sixth largest of the modern constellations, and the one that extends farthest in the sky from north to south. The same name was later taken as a Latin name for the real Po River and also for the name of a minor river in Athens.
