  **Andromeda** is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century Greco-Roman astronomer [Ptolemy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy/), and one of the 88 modern constellations. Located in the [northern celestial hemisphere](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_celestial_hemisphere/), it is named for Andromeda, daughter of Cassiopeia, in the Greek myth, who was chained to a rock to be eaten by the sea monster Cetus. Andromeda is most prominent during autumn evenings in the Northern Hemisphere, along with several other constellations named for characters in the Perseus myth. Because of its northern declination, Andromeda is visible only north of 40° south latitude; for observers farther south, it lies below the horizon. It is one of the largest constellations, with an area of 722 square degrees. This is over 1,400 times the size of the full [moon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon/), 55% of the size of the largest constellation, [Hydra](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_(constellation)/), and over 10 times the size of the smallest constellation, [Crux](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crux/).
