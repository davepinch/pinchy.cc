  **Perseus** is a constellation in the northern sky, being named after the Greek mythological hero Perseus. It is one of the 48 ancient constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer [Ptolemy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy/), and among the 88 modern constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It is located near several other constellations named after ancient Greek legends surrounding Perseus, including [Andromeda](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_(constellation)/) to the west and [Cassiopeia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_(constellation)/) to the north. Perseus is also bordered by [Aries](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aries_(constellation)/) and [Taurus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_(constellation)) to the south, [Auriga](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auriga_(constellation)/) to the east, [Camelopardalis](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelopardalis/) to the north, and [Triangulum](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulum/) to the west. Some star atlases during the early 19th century also depicted Perseus holding the disembodied head of Medusa, whose asterism was named together as Perseus et Caput Medusae; however, this never came into popular usage.
