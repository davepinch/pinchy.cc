excerpt: >-
  Perseus (Περσεύς in Greek) is one of the most famous Greek heroes. The characters in his story are represented by six constellations that occupy a substantial part of the sky. The constellation depicting Perseus lies in a prominent part of the Milky Way, which is perhaps why Aratus termed him ‘dust-stained’.
