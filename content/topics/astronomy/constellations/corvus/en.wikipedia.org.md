  **Corvus** is a small constellation in the [Southern Celestial Hemisphere](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_celestial_hemisphere/). Its name means "crow" in Latin. One of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer [Ptolemy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy/), it depicts a raven, a bird associated with stories about the god Apollo, perched on the back of Hydra the water snake. The four brightest stars, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, and Beta Corvi, form a distinctive quadrilateral in the night sky.
