excerpt: >-
  High in the northern sky stands a forlorn-looking charioteer. With his right hand he grasps the reins of a chariot, while on his left arm he carries a goat and its two kids. Of his chariot itself there is no sign. Whatâ€™s the story here? Mythology offers several identifications for this prominent constellation, although the presence of the goat is not accounted for by any of them.
