  **Auriga** is a constellation in the [northern celestial hemisphere](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_celestial_hemisphere). It is one of the 88 modern constellations; it was among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer [Ptolemy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy). Its name is Latin for '(the) charioteer', associating it with various mythological beings, including Erichthonius and Myrtilus. Auriga is most prominent during winter evenings in the northern Hemisphere, as are five other constellations that have stars in the Winter Hexagon asterism. Because of its northern declination, Auriga is only visible in its entirety as far south as -34Â°; for observers farther south it lies partially or fully below the horizon. A large constellation, with an area of 657 square degrees, it is half the size of the largest, [Hydra](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_(constellation)).
