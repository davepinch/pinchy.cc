excerpt: >-
  **Grus** (/ˈɡrʌs/, or colloquially /ˈɡruːs/) is a constellation in the [southern sky](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_celestial_hemisphere/). Its name is Latin for the [crane](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_(bird)/), a type of bird. It is one of twelve constellations conceived by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. Grus first appeared on a 35-centimetre-diameter (14-inch) celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius and was depicted in Johann Bayer's star atlas *Uranometria* of 1603. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille gave Bayer designations to its stars in 1756, some of which had been previously considered part of the neighbouring constellation Piscis Austrinus. The constellations Grus, Pavo, Phoenix and Tucana are collectively known as the "Southern Birds".
