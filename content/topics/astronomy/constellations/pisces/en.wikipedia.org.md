  **Pisces** is a constellation of the [zodiac]( /en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac/). Its vast bulk – and main asterism viewed in most European cultures per Greco-Roman antiquity as a distant pair of fishes connected by one cord each that join at an apex – are in the Northern celestial hemisphere. Its old astronomical symbol is Pisces symbol (♓︎). Its name is Latin for "fishes". It is between [Aquarius](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarius_(constellation)/), of similar size, to the southwest and [Aries](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aries_(constellation)/), which is smaller, to the east. The ecliptic and the celestial equator intersect within this constellation and in [Virgo](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_(constellation)/). This means the [sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun/) passes directly overhead of the equator, on average, at approximately this point in the sky, at the March equinox.
