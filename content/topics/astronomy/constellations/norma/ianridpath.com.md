excerpt: >-
  Norma is one of the constellations introduced by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille following his mapping of the southern skies in 1751–52. It consists of faint stars between Ara and Lupus that were not catalogued by Ptolemy. On his 1756 planisphere Lacaille called it *l’Equerre et la Regle*, although in his accompanying star catalogue the name was given simply as *l'Équerre*. In the notes to his catalogue he described it as representing an architect’s set-square and ruler.
