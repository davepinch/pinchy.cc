  **Cygnus** is a northern constellation on the plane of the [Milky Way](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way/), deriving its name from the Latinized Greek word for swan. Cygnus is one of the most recognizable constellations of the northern summer and autumn, and it features a prominent asterism known as the Northern Cross (in contrast to the [Southern Cross](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crux/)). Cygnus was among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [Ptolemy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy/), and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations.
