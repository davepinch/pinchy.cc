excerpt: >-
  **Vela** is a constellation in the [southern sky](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_celestial_hemisphere/), which contains the Vela Supercluster. Its name is Latin for the sails of a ship, and it was originally part of a larger constellation, the ship [Argo Navis](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argo_Navis/), which was later divided into three parts, the others being [Carina](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carina_(constellation)/) and [Puppis](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppis/). With an apparent magnitude of 1.8, its brightest star is the hot blue multiple star Gamma Velorum, one component of which is the brightest Wolf-Rayet star in the sky. Delta and Kappa Velorum, together with Epsilon and Iota Carinae, form the asterism known as the False Cross. 1.95-magnitude Delta is actually a triple or quintuple star system.
