  Triangulum is a small constellation in the [northern sky](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_celestial_hemisphere/). Its name is Latin for "triangle", derived from its three brightest stars, which form a long and narrow triangle. Known to the ancient Babylonians and Greeks, Triangulum was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [Ptolemy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy/). The celestial cartographers Johann Bayer and John Flamsteed catalogued the constellation's stars, giving six of them Bayer designations.
