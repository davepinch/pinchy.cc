excerpt: >-
  **Antlia** (/ˈæntliə/; from Ancient Greek *ἀντλία*) is a constellation in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere. Its name means "pump" in Latin and Greek; it represents an air pump. Originally **Antlia Pneumatica**, the constellation was established by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille in the 18th century. Its non-specific (single-word) name, already in limited use, was preferred by John Herschel then welcomed by the astronomic community which officially accepted this. North of stars forming some of the sails of the ship [Argo Navis](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argo_Navis/) (the constellation [Vela](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vela_(constellation)/)), Antlia is completely visible from latitudes south of 49 degrees north.
