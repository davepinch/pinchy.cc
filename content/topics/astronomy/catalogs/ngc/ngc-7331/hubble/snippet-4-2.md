  Late autumn skies will provide the best view from the Northern Hemisphere (or spring skies in the Southern Hemisphere). However, with a magnitude of 9.5, Caldwell 30 will require a telescope or large binoculars to see it for yourself. In light-polluted skies, only the central core of the galaxy is visible. Under dark skies, a large telescope will also reveal the galaxy’s sweeping spiral arms.
