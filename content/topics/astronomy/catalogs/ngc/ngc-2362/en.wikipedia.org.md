  **NGC 2362**, also known as **Caldwell 64**, is an open cluster of stars in the southern constellation of [Canis Major](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis_Major/). It was discovered by the Italian court astronomer Giovanni Batista Hodierna, who published his finding in 1654. William Herschel called it a "beautiful cluster", while William Henry Smyth said it "has a beautiful appearance, the bright white star being surrounded by a rich gathering of minute companions, in a slightly elongated form, and nearly vertical position". In the past it has also been listed as a nebula, but in 1930 Robert J. Trumpler found no evidence of nebulosity. The brightest member star system is Tau Canis Majoris, and therefore it is sometimes called the **Tau Canis Majoris Cluster**.
