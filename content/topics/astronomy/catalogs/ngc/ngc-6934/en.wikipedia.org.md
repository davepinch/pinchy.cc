excerpt: >-
  **NGC 6934** (also known as **Caldwell 47**) is a globular cluster of stars in the northern constellation of Delphinus, about 52 kilolight-years distant from the Sun. It was discovered by the German-born astronomer William Herschel on 24 September 1785. The cluster is following a highly eccentric orbit (with an eccentricity of 0.81) through the Milky Way along an orbital plane that is inclined by 73Â° to the galactic plane. It may share a common dynamic origin with NGC 5466. As of 2018, it has been poorly studied.
