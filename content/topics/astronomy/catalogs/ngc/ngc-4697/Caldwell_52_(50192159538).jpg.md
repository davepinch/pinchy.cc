excerpt: >-
  Located in the constellation Virgo, Caldwell 52 is the first Caldwell object (numerically) that resides in the southern celestial hemisphere (south of the celestial equator). This elliptical galaxy is visible from both the Northern and Southern hemispheres, appearing highest in the spring for northern observers and in autumn for southern observers. It lies roughly 40 million light-years from Earth and has an apparent magnitude of 10.9. The galaxyâ€™s core can be spotted with a small telescope in a suburban sky. From a darker location, the galaxy appears as an elongated patch of fuzz.
