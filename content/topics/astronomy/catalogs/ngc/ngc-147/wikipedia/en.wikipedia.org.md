  **NGC 147** (also known as **DDO3** or **Caldwell 17**) is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy about 2.58 Mly away in the constellation [Cassiopeia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_(constellation)/). NGC 147 is a member of the [Local group](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group/) of galaxies and a satellite galaxy of the [Andromeda Galaxy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy/) (M31). It forms a physical pair with the nearby galaxy NGC 185, another remote satellite of M31. It was discovered by John Herschel in September 1829. Visually it is both fainter and slightly larger than NGC 185 (and therefore has a considerably lower surface brightness). This means that NGC 147 is more difficult to see than NGC 185, which is visible in small telescopes.
