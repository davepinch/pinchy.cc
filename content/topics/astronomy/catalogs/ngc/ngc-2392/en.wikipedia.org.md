  The **Eskimo Nebula** (**NGC 2392**), also known as the **Clown-faced Nebula**, **Lion Nebula**, or **Caldwell 39**, is a bipolar double-shell planetary nebula (PN). It was discovered by astronomer William Herschel in 1787. The formation resembles a person's head surrounded by a parka hood. It is surrounded by gas that composed the outer layers of a Sun-like star. The visible inner filaments are ejected by a strong wind of particles from the central star. The outer disk contains unusual, light-year-long filaments.
