title: "Visibility of NGC 3201 (Wikimedia Commons)"
✂️: "With a magnitude of 6.7, it’s just a bit too dim to be seen with the unaided eye. A pair of binoculars is sufficient to view the cluster, though it will be a much more impressive spectacle viewed through a telescope. Unfortunately, Caldwell 79 [NGC 3201] isn’t easily visible from most northern latitudes, except those close to the equator, where observers can look for it in the springtime. The cluster is best viewed from the Southern Hemisphere during autumn months."
