  This Hubble image features stars at the center of the glittering globular cluster Caldwell 79. Globular clusters are dense, gravitationally bound packs of stars that roam the fringes of the galaxy. Most of the Milky Way’s globular clusters are estimated to be over 10 billion years old — about twice as old as our solar system. They typically contain hundreds of thousands of stars that are thought to have formed at roughly the same time. They also contain some of the most ancient stars in our galaxy, but their role in galactic evolution is still a matter of study.
