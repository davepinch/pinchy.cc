  The **Little Dumbbell Nebula**, also known as **Messier 76**, **NGC 650/651**, the **Barbell Nebula**, or the **Cork Nebula**, is a planetary nebula in the northern constellation of Perseus. It was discovered by Pierre MÃ©chain in 1780 and included in Charles Messier's catalog of comet-like objects as number 76. It was first classified as a planetary nebula in 1918 by the astronomer Heber Doust Curtis. However, others might have previously recognized it as a planetary nebula; for example, William Huggins found its spectrum indicated it was a nebula (instead of a galaxy or a star cluster); and Isaac Roberts in 1891 suggested that M76 might be similar to the Ring Nebula (M57), as seen instead from the side view.
