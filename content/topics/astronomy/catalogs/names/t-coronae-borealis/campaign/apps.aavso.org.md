title: "Monitoring T CrB (apps.aavso.org)"
excerpt: >-
  The AAVSO and multiple astronomers request ongoing monitoring of the recurrent nova T CrB 1) to alert the astronomical community as soon as T CrB begins its eruption, and 2) to continue to build its multicolor light curve prior to, during, and after the anticipated eruption. Observations with all filters, as well as visual observations, are requested. Spectroscopy is also requested. Observations should be reported to the AAVSO International Database (AID) or AAVSO Spectroscopy Database (AVSpec) as soon as possible after making them.
