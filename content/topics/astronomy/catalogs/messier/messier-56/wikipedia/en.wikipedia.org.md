  **Messier 56** (also known as M56 or NGC 6779) is a [globular cluster](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster/) in the constellation [Lyra](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyra/). It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1779. It is angularly found about midway between Albireo (Beta (β) Cygni) and Sulafat (Gamma (γ) Lyrae). In a good night sky it is tricky to find with large (50–80 mm) binoculars, appearing as a slightly fuzzy star. The cluster can be resolved using a telescope with an aperture of 8 in (20 cm) or larger.
