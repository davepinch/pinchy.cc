  **Messier 35** or **M35**, also known as **NGC 2168** or the **Shoe-Buckle Cluster**, is a relatively close open cluster of stars in the west of [Gemini](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(constellation)/), at about the declination of the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun/) when the latter is at June solstice. It was discovered by Philippe Loys de Chéseaux around 1745 and independently discovered by John Bevis before 1750. It is scattered over part of the sky almost the size of the full moon and is 2,970 light-years (912 parsecs) away. The compact open cluster NGC 2158 lies directly southwest of it.
