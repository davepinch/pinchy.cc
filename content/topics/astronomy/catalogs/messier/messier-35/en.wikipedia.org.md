excerpt: >-
  **Messier 35** or **M35**, also known as **NGC 2168** or the **Shoe-Buckle Cluster**, is a relatively close open cluster of stars in the west of [Gemini](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(constellation)/), at about the declination of the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun/) when the latter is at June solstice. It was discovered by Philippe Loys de Ch√©seaux around 1745 and independently discovered by John Bevis before 1750. It is scattered over part of the sky almost the size of the full moon and is 2,970 light-years (912 parsecs) away. The compact open cluster NGC 2158 lies directly southwest of it.
