  **Messier 94** (also known as **NGC 4736**, **Cat's Eye Galaxy**, **Crocodile Eye Galaxy**, or **Croc's Eye Galaxy**) is a spiral galaxy in the mid-northern constellation Canes Venatici. It was discovered by Pierre Méchain in 1781, and catalogued by Charles Messier two days later. Although some references describe M94 as a barred spiral galaxy, the "bar" structure appears to be more oval-shaped. The galaxy has two ring structures.
