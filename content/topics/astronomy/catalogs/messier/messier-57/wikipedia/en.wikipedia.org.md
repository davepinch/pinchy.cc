  The **Ring Nebula** (also catalogued as **Messier 57**, **M57** and **NGC 6720**) is a planetary nebula in the northern constellation of [Lyra](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyra/). Such a nebula is formed when a star, during the last stages of its evolution before becoming a white dwarf, expels a vast luminous envelope of ionized gas into the surrounding interstellar space.
