  **Messier 102** (also known as **M102**) is a galaxy listed in the Messier Catalogue that cannot be unambiguously identified. Its original discoverer Pierre MÃ©chain retracted his discovery two years after publication and said that it was a duplicate observation of Messier 101. Later historical evidence favors that M102 is actually the galaxy NGC 5866, although other galaxies have been suggested as possible identities. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) considers it to be the same as NGC 5866.
