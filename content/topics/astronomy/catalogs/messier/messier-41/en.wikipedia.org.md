  **Messier 41** (also known as **M41** or **NGC 2287**) is an open cluster in the constellation [Canis Major](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis_Major/). It is sometimes referred to as the **Little Beehive Cluster**. It was discovered by Giovanni Batista Hodierna before 1654 and was perhaps known to Aristotle about 325 BC. It lies about four degrees almost exactly south of Sirius, with which it forms a roughly equilateral triangle with Nu^2 Canis Majoris to the west—all three figure in the same field in binoculars.
