excerpt: >-
  The Milky Way is surrounded by more than 50 near neighbour galaxies that make up the Local Group. The two largest galaxies are us and Andromeda, but we also have an often-overlooked third large galaxy in our neighbourhood- the Triangulum Galaxy. This galaxy is like its own mini-Milky Way, containing stars, clouds, clusters, supernova remnants, and satellites. These are the checkpoints in the Triangulum Galaxy which make up our tour today.
