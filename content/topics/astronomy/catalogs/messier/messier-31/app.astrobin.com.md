collaborative imaging of: Messier 31
excerpt: >-
  After half a year of work, the Deep Sky Collective is happy to present its latest project - a kilo hour on M31. Not only does this image set new boundaries of what’s possible with collaborative imaging, its release also marks the DSC’s anniversary project! Being launched the 13rd February last year, we never thought we could achieve what we did so far - huge thanks to everyone involved in the DSC and for keeping on believing in what we do.
