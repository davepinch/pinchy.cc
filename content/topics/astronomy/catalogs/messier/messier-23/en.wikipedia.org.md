  **Messier 23**, also known as **NGC 6494**, is an open cluster of stars in the northwest of the southern constellation of Sagittarius. It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1764. It can be found in good conditions with binoculars or a modestly sized telescope. It is in front of "an extensive gas and dust network", which there may be no inter-association. It is within 5Â° the sun's position (namely in mid-December) so can be occulted by the moon.
