  **Messier 22** or **M22**, also known as **NGC 6656** or the **Great Sagittarius Cluster**, is an elliptical globular cluster of stars in the constellation Sagittarius, near the Galactic bulge region. It is one of the brightest globulars visible in the night sky. The brightest stars are 11th magnitude, with hundreds of stars bright enough to resolve with an 8" telescope. It is just south of the sun's position in mid-December, and northeast of Lambda Sagittarii (Kaus Borealis), the northernmost star of the "Teapot" asterism.
