  **Messier 39** or **M39**, also known as **NGC 7092**, is an open cluster of stars in the constellation of [Cygnus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_(constellation)/), positioned two degrees to the south of the star Pi Cygni and around 9° east-northeast of [Deneb](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deneb/). The cluster was discovered by Guillaume Le Gentil in 1749, then Charles Messier added it to his catalogue in 1764. When observed in a small telescope at low power the cluster shows around two dozen members but is best observed with binoculars. It has a total integrated magnitude (brightness) of 5.5 and spans an angular diameter of 29 arcminutes – about the size of the full Moon. It is centered about 1,010 light-years (311 parsecs) away.
