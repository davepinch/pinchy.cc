excerpt: >-
  The **Beehive Cluster** (also known as **Praesepe** (Latin for "manger", "cot" or "crib"), **M44**, **NGC 2632**, or **Cr 189**), is an open cluster in the constellation [Cancer](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_(constellation)/). One of the nearest open clusters to [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/), it contains a larger population of stars than other nearby bright open clusters holding around 1,000 stars. Under dark skies, the Beehive Cluster looks like a small nebulous object to the naked eye, and has been known since ancient times. Classical astronomer [Ptolemy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy/) described it as a "nebulous mass in the breast of Cancer". It was among the first objects that Galileo studied with his telescope.
