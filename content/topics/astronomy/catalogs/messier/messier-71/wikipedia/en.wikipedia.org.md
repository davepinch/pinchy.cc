  **Messier 71** (also known as **M71**, **NGC 6838**, or the **Angelfish Cluster**) is a globular cluster in the small northern constellation Sagitta. It was discovered by Philippe Loys de Chéseaux in 1745 and included by Charles Messier in his catalog of non-comet-like objects in 1780. It was also noted by Koehler at Dresden around 1775. Messier 71 is also known as NGC 6839 and The Bernardo Star, though this identification is very uncertain.
