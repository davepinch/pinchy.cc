excerpt: >-
  **Theta Scorpii** (**θ Scorpii**, abbreviated **Theta Sco**, **θ Sco**) is a binary star in the southern zodiac constellation of Scorpius. The apparent visual magnitude of this star is +1.87, making it readily visible to the naked eye and one of the brightest stars in the night sky. It is sufficiently near that the distance can be measured directly using the parallax technique and such measurements obtained during the Hipparcos mission yield an estimate of approximately 329 light-years (101 parsecs) from the Sun.
