excerpt: >-
  Caldwell 51, also known as IC 1613, is an irregular dwarf galaxy located in the constellation Cetus. This member of our Local Group of galaxies is located just 2.3 million light-years from Earth and has an apparent magnitude of 9.9. Despite its relative proximity, Caldwell 51 is very difficult to spot and is one of the most elusive Caldwell objects. It appears as an extremely faint and diffuse smudge in the sky, even when viewed through moderately sized telescopes. The galaxy is visible from the Northern Hemisphere in the autumn and from the northern regions of the Southern Hemisphere in the spring. It was discovered in 1906 by the German astrophotographer Max Wolf, who also found many other astronomical objects over the course of his life, including comets, supernovae, and asteroids.
