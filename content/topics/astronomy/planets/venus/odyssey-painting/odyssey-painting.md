title: "Odyssey painting of Venus (microfilm scan)"
license: unknown
note: >-
  I remember this painting from my childhood. I had subscribed to *Odyssey*, an astronomy magazine for children, starting sometime in '85 or '86. One evening my parents brought us kids to the public library in Stillwater, Minnesota.  I was delighted to find the library had copies of the magazine from before the start of my subscription. I remember this picture. It was compelling to me. This is a B&W microfilm copy found through Anna's Archive. I am still looking for the color version.
