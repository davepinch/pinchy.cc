excerpt: >-
  The **Perseids** are a prolific meteor shower associated with the comet Swiftâ€“Tuttle that are usually visible from mid-July to late-August. The meteors are called the Perseids because they appear from the general direction of the constellation Perseus and in more modern times have a radiant bordering on Cassiopeia and Camelopardalis.
