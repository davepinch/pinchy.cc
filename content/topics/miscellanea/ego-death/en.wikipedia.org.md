excerpt: >-
  **Ego death** is a "complete loss of subjective self-identity". The term is used in various intertwined contexts, with related meanings. Jungian psychology uses the synonymous term **psychic death**, referring to a fundamental transformation of the psyche. In death and rebirth mythology, ego death is a phase of **self-surrender and transition**, as described by [Joseph Campbell](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell) in his research on the mythology of the Hero's Journey. It is a recurrent theme in world mythology and is also used as a metaphor in some strands of contemporary western thinking.
