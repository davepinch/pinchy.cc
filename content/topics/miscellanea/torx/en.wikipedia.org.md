excerpt: >-
  **Torx** (pronounced /tɔːrks/) is a trademark for a type of screw drive characterized by a 6-point star-shaped pattern, developed in 1967 by Camcar Textron. A popular generic name for the drive is *star*, as in **star screwdriver** or **star bits**. The official generic name, standardized by the International Organization for Standardization as **ISO 10664**, is **hexalobular internal**. This is sometimes abbreviated in databases and catalogs as **6lobe** (starting with the numeral 6, not the capital letter G). **Torx Plus**, **Torx Paralobe** and **Torx ttap** are improved head profiles.
