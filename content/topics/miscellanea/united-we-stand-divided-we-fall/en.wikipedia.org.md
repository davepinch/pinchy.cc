title: "United we stand, divided we fall (Wikipedia)"
excerpt: >-
  "**United we stand, divided we fall**" is a phrase used in many different kinds of mottos, most often to inspire unity and collaboration. Its core concept lies in the collectivist notion that if individual members of a certain group with binding ideals – such as a union, coalition, confederation or alliance – work on their own instead of as a team, they are each doomed to fail and will all be defeated. The phrase is also often referred to with only the words "**United we stand**".
