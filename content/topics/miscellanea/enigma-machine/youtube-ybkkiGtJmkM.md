title: "How did the Enigma Machine work? (youtube.com)"
excerpt: >-
  Let's use 3D animation to go inside the Enigma Machine! The Enigma Machine was used during WWII by the German Army to get keep messages encrypted.  It looks almost like a typewriter.  There are 26 keys and 26 letters that can light up.  These lights tell you how the keys will be scrambled up.  The machine works like an electrical circuit.  The rotors towards the back of the machine do most of the scrambling by mixing up the wiring.  The plugboard in the front also another layer of encryption.  Keyboard mechanism connects or disconnects the circuit to turn on a lightbulb.  The path of the wire is difficult to follow so I recommend following it through in 3D!  Each time a key is released - the rotors in the back will turn.  This is done by the mechanism which includes the actuator bar, ratchet, pawl, and the index wheels.

This is an excellent visualization of the Enigma machine. I feel I learned more about the Enigma than any other video. However, the ending abruptly transitions to an advertisement for Brilliant instead of ending on a solid note. I am interested in subscribing to Brilliant but their method of advertising turns me off, so I will not. Try to not let Brilliant detract you from the rest of this excellent video.
