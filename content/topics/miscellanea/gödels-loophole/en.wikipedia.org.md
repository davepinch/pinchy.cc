title: "Gödel's Loophole (Wikipedia)"
excerpt: >-
  **Gödel's Loophole** is an "inner contradiction" in the [Constitution of the United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States/) which Austrian-American logician, mathematician, and analytic philosopher [Kurt Gödel](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Gödel/) postulated in 1947. The loophole would permit the American democracy to be legally turned into a dictatorship. Gödel told his friend [Oskar Morgenstern](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Morgenstern/) about the existence of the flaw and Morgenstern told [Albert Einstein](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein/) about it at the time, but Morgenstern, in his recollection of the incident in 1971, never mentioned the exact problem as Gödel saw it. This has led to speculation about the precise nature of what has come to be called "Gödel's Loophole". It has been called "one of the great unsolved problems of constitutional law" by F. E. Guerra-Pujol.
