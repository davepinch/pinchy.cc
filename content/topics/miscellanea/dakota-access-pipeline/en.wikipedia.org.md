excerpt: >-
  The **Dakota Access Pipeline** (**DAPL**) or **Bakken pipeline** is a 1,172-mile-long (1,886 km) underground pipeline in the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States/) that has the ability to transport up to 750,000 barrels of light sweet crude oil per day. It begins in the shale oil fields of the Bakken Formation in northwest [North Dakota](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota/) and continues through [South Dakota](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota/) and [Iowa](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa/) to an oil terminal near Patoka, [Illinois](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois/). Together with the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline from Patoka to Nederland, [Texas](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas/), it forms the Bakken system. The pipeline transports 40 percent of the oil produced in the Bakken region.
