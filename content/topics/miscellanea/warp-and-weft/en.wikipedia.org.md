excerpt: >-
  In the manufacture of cloth, **warp** and **weft** are the two basic components in weaving to transform thread and yarn into textile fabrics. The vertical *warp* yarns are held stationary in tension on a loom (frame) while the horizontal **weft** (also the **woof**) is drawn through (inserted) over and under the warp thread. In the terminology of weaving, each warp thread is called a *warp end*; a *pick* is a single weft thread that crosses the warp thread, synonymous terms are *fill* yarn and *filling yarn*.
