excerpt: >-
  A **hippie**, also spelled **hippy**, especially in British English, is someone associated with the counterculture of the 1960s, originally a youth movement that began in the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States/) during or around 1964 and spread to different countries around the world. The word hippie came from hipster and was used to describe beatniks who moved into New York City's Greenwich Village, in [San Francisco](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco/)'s Haight-Ashbury district, and [Chicago](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago/)'s Old Town community. The term hippie was used in print by San Francisco writer Michael Fallon, helping popularize use of the term in the media, although the tag was seen elsewhere earlier.
