excerpt: >-
  Since 2020, [Haiti](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti/)'s capital, [Port-au-Prince](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-au-Prince/), has been the site of an ongoing gang war between two major criminal groups and their allies: the Revolutionary Forces of the G9 Family and Allies (FRG9 or G9) and the G-Pep. The Government of Haiti and Haitian security forces have struggled to maintain their control of Port-au-Prince amid this conflict, with gangs reportedly controlling up to 90% of the city by 2023.
