  On June 22, 2025, the United States Air Force and Navy attacked three nuclear facilities in Iran as part of the Iran–Israel war. The Fordow Uranium Enrichment Plant, the Natanz Nuclear Facility, and the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center were targeted with fourteen GBU-57A/B MOP 30,000-pound (14,000 kg) bombs carried by Northrop B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, and with a separate barrage of Tomahawk missiles fired from a submarine. The attack, which was given the codename **Operation Midnight Hammer**, was the United States's first offensive action of the Iran–Israel war, which began on June 13 with surprise Israeli strikes.
