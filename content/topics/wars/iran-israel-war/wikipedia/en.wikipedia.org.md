excerpt: >-
  The ongoing armed conflict between Iran and the Houthi movement in Yemen against Israel and the United States began on 13 June 2025, when Israel launched a surprise series of attacks on key Iranian military and nuclear facilities. In the opening hours of the war, Israelis forces assassinated some of Iran's top military leaders, nuclear scientists, and politicians; and damaged or destroyed Iran's air defenses and some of its nuclear and military facilities. Iran retaliated by launching missiles at military sites and cities in Israel. The Iran-allied Houthis have also fired several missiles at Israel, in an adjunct of the Red Sea crisis. For the first nine days of the war, the United States refrained from military activity other than defending Israel against incoming Iranian missiles and drones, but on 22 June, it took offensive action by striking three Iranian nuclear sites. The Houthis took the American strikes as a "declaration of war" and unilaterally ended its May 2025 United States–Houthi ceasefire.
