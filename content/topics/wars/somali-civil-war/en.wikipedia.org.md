  The **Somali Civil War** (Somali: *Dagaalkii Sokeeye ee Soomaaliya*; Arabic: الحرب الأهلية الصومالية *al-ḥarb al-’ahliyya aṣ-ṣūmāliyya*) is an ongoing civil war that is taking place in Somalia. It grew out of resistance to the military junta which was led by Siad Barre during the 1980s. From 1988 to 1990, the Somali Armed Forces began engaging in combat against various armed rebel groups, including the Somali Salvation Democratic Front in the northeast, the Somali National Movement in the northwest, and the United Somali Congress in the south. The clan-based armed opposition groups overthrew the Barre government in 1991.
