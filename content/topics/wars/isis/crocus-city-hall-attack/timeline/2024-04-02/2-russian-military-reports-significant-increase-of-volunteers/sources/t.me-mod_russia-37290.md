## Translated from Russian

**In Moscow and other Russian cities, the number of people wishing to enter military service under contract in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation**

has increased significantly Since the beginning of this year, more than 100 thousand people have already entered military service under contract in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.

At the same time, over the past week and a half, a significant increase in the number of those wishing to conclude contracts with the Russian Ministry of Defense in order to take part in a special military operation has been recorded at the selection points for contract military service in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.

Every day, up to 1,700 people come to contract selection centers across the country to enlist in the military. In total, over the past 10 days, about 16 thousand citizens have signed contracts to participate in the special military operation.

During the interviews conducted over the past week at selection points in Russian cities, most candidates indicated the desire to avenge those who died in the tragedy that occurred on March 22, 2024 in the Moscow region as the main motive for concluding a contract.

*Earlier, the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation, General of the Army Sergei Shoigu, said that by the end of 2024, it is planned to form two combined arms armies and thirty formations, including fourteen divisions and sixteen brigades, in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.*
