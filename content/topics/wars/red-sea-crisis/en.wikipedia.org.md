excerpt: >-
  The **Red Sea crisis** began on 19 October 2023, when the Iran-backed Houthi movement in Yemen launched missiles and armed drones at [Israel](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel/), demanding an end to the invasion of the Gaza Strip. The Houthis have since seized and launched aerial attacks against dozens of merchant and naval vessels in the Red Sea, drawing hundreds of air strikes on missile sites and other targets by US and allied forces. The crisis is linked to the [Israel–Hamas war](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel–Hamas_war/), the Iran–Israel proxy conflict, the Iran–United States proxy conflict, and the Yemeni crisis.
