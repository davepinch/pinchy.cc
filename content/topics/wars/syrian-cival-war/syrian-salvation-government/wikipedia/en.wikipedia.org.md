  The **Syrian Salvation Government** (SSG; Arabic: حكومة الإنقاذ السورية, romanized: *Ḥukūmat al-ʾInqādh al-Sūriyya*) is a de facto alternative government of the Syrian opposition in Idlib Governorate, formed in early November 2017 under the initiative of the Hayʼat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) rebel coalition in the context of the Syrian civil war. There followed weeks of conflict between the Syrian Salvation Government and the Syrian Interim Government (SIG), with reports of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham unilaterally disbanding several SIG-supported local councils across northwestern Syria.
