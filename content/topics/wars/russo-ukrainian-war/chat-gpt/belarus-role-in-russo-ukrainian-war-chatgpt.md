prompt: >-
  Please summarize the role of Belarus in the Russo-Ukrainian war as a single paragraph with the most important points.
excerpt: >-
  Belarus has played a significant but indirect role in the Russo-Ukrainian War, acting as a key ally of Russia under the leadership of President Alexander Lukashenko. While Belarus has not committed its own troops to the conflict, it has provided critical logistical support to Russia. This includes allowing Russian forces to use Belarusian territory for staging and launching attacks, particularly during the initial invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, when Russian troops advanced toward Kyiv from Belarus. Additionally, Belarus has hosted joint military exercises with Russia and permitted its airspace to be used for missile strikes on Ukraine. Lukashenkoâ€™s regime has faced international sanctions and diplomatic isolation as a result of its support for Russia, but it continues to align closely with Moscow, relying heavily on Russian economic and political backing to maintain its own stability.
