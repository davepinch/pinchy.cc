excerpt: >-
  The **Russo-Ukrainian War** is an ongoing international conflict between [Russia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia/) and [Ukraine](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine/), which began in February 2014. Following Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity, Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine and supported pro-Russian separatists fighting the Ukrainian military in the Donbas war. The first eight years of conflict also included naval incidents, cyberwarfare, and heightened political tensions. In February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and began occupying more of the country.
