excerpt: >-
  **Millennials**, also known as **Generation Y** or **Gen Y**, are the demographic cohort following [Generation X](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X/) and preceding Generation Z. Researchers and popular media use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years, with the generation typically being defined as people born from 1981 to 1996. Most Millennials are the children of Baby Boomers and older Generation X. In turn Millennials are often the parents of Generation Alpha.
