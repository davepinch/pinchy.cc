excerpt: >-
  **Millennials**, also known as **Generation Y** or **Gen Y**, are the demographic cohort following [Generation X](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X/) and preceding [Generation Z](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z/). Researchers and popular media use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years, with the generation typically being defined as people born from 1981 to 1996. Most Millennials are the children of [Baby Boomers](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers/) and older Generation X. In turn Millennials are often the parents of [Generation Alpha](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Alpha/).
