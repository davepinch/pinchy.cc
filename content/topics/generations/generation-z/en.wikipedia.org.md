excerpt: >-
  **Generation Z** (often shortened to **Gen Z**), colloquially known as **Zoomers**, is the demographic cohort succeeding [Millennials](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials/) and preceding [Generation Alpha](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Alpha/). Researchers and popular media use the mid-to-late 1990s as starting birth years and the early 2010s as ending birth years. Most members of Generation Z are the children of [Generation X](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X/) or older Millennials.
