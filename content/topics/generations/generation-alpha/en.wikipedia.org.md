excerpt: >-
  **Generation Alpha** (often shortened to **Gen Alpha**) is the demographic cohort succeeding [Generation Z](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z/). Researchers and popular media use the early 2010s as starting birth years to the mid-2020s as the ending birth years (see ยง Date and age range definitions). Named after alpha, the first letter in the Greek alphabet, Generation Alpha is the first to be born entirely in the 21st century and the third millennium. Most members of Generation Alpha are the children of [millennials](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials/).
