excerpt: >-
  **Baby boomers**, often shortened to **boomers**, are the demographic cohort preceded by the [Silent Generation](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Generation/) and followed by [Generation X](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X/). The generation is often defined as people born from 1946 to 1964 during the mid-20th century baby boom. The dates, the demographic context, and the cultural identifiers may vary by country. Most baby boomers are the children of either the [Greatest Generation](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_Generation/) or the Silent Generation, and are often parents of [Millennials](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials/).
