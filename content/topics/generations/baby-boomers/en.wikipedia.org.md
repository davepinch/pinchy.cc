excerpt: >-
  **Baby boomers**, often shortened to **boomers**, are the demographic cohort preceded by the Silent Generation and followed by [Generation X](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X/). The generation is often defined as people born from 1946 to 1964 during the mid-20th century baby boom. The dates, the demographic context, and the cultural identifiers may vary by country. Most baby boomers are the children of either the Greatest Generation or the Silent Generation, and are often parents of [Millennials](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials/).
