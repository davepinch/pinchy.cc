excerpt: >-
  **Generation X** (often shortened to **Gen X**) is the demographic cohort following the [Baby Boomers](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers/) and preceding [Millennials](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials/). Researchers and popular media often use the mid-1960s as its starting birth years and the late 1970s as its ending birth years, with the generation being generally defined as people born from 1965 to 1980. By this definition and U.S. Census data, there are 65.2 million Gen Xers in the United States as of 2019. Most of Generation X are the children of the [Silent Generation](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Generation/) and early Baby Boomers; Xers are also often the parents of Millennials and [Generation Z](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z/).
