excerpt: >-
  **Electronic body music** (**EBM**) is a genre of [electronic music](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music/) that combines elements of industrial music and synth-punk with elements of dance music. It developed in the early 1980s in Western Europe, as an outgrowth of both the punk and the industrial music cultures. It combines sequenced repetitive basslines, programmed dance music rhythms, and mostly undistorted vocals and command-like shouts with confrontational or provocative themes.
