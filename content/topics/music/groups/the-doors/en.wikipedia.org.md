  **The Doors** were an American rock band formed in [Los Angeles](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles) in 1965, with vocalist [Jim Morrison](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Morrison/), keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger, and drummer John Densmore. They were among the most influential and controversial rock acts of the 1960s, partly due to Morrison's lyrics and voice, along with his erratic stage persona. The group is widely regarded as an important figure of the era's counterculture.
