excerpt: >-
  A **honey bee** (also spelled **honeybee**) is a eusocial flying insect within the genus *Apis* of the bee clade, all native to Afro-Eurasia. After bees spread naturally throughout Africa and Eurasia, humans became responsible for the current cosmopolitan distribution of honey bees, introducing multiple subspecies into South America (early 16th century), North America (early 17th century), and [Australia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) (early 19th century).
