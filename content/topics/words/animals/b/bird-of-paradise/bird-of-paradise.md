At the 2023 Above & Beyond concert, I was dancing at the main stage with Mary. A woman asked me my favorite bird. I could not think of a bird easily. I may have considered [Cygnus](/cygnus/) but I said Bird of Paradise. She gave an interesting fact about a bird, I think an Ostrich, but I do not remember at the moment [July 27, 2023].
