  ***Corvus*** is a widely distributed genus of medium-sized to large [birds](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird) in the family Corvidae. It includes species commonly known as crows, ravens, and rooks. The species commonly encountered in Europe are the carrion crow, hooded crow, common raven, and rook; those discovered later were named "crow" or "raven" chiefly on the basis of their size, crows generally being smaller. The genus name is Latin for "raven".
