**Sheep** or **domestic sheep** (***Ovis aries***) are domesticated, ruminant mammals typically kept as livestock. Although the term sheep can apply to other species in the genus *Ovis*, in everyday usage it almost always refers to domesticated sheep. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female is referred to as a *ewe* (/juÀê/), an intact male as a *ram*, occasionally a *tup*, a castrated male as a *wether*, and a young sheep as a *lamb*.
