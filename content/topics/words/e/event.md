  - "May 9, 2025: This page is the first page I was able to get archived from a PowerShell script. My plan is to run a script that slowly walks through the website, automatically archiving pages that need to be archived. For fun, I would like a different sound to be played depending on the status of a page, e.g., a short tick for a page already archived. Currently the script has some bugs (an error was displayed) but this is a big move toward the script."
