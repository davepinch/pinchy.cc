excerpt: >-
  Trees are essential for our life and are an important link between the past, present, and future. They temper the summer heat, help us take a deep breath and stabilize the climate. We should protect and care for them. Will you help with our mission so that the benefits of Europe's trees can be enjoyed by future generations?
