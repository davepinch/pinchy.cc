excerpt: >-
  A **landlocked country** is a country that does not have territory connected to an ocean or whose coastlines lie solely on endorheic basins. Currently, there are 44 landlocked countries, two of them doubly landlocked ([Liechtenstein](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liechtenstein/) and [Uzbekistan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbekistan/)), and three landlocked de facto states in the world. [Kazakhstan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan/) is the world's largest landlocked country, while [Ethiopia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia/) is the world's most populous landlocked country.
