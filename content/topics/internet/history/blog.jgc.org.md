title: "The original WWW proposal is a Word for Macintosh 4.0 file from 1990, can we open it? (blog.jgc.com)"
excerpt: >-
  The W3C has a page with the original WWW proposal from Tim Berners-Lee. One of the downloads says *The original document file (I think - I can't test it)*. The "I can't test it" made me sad. There are two other files (an RTF version and an HTML version generated in 1998 from the original file). But can we open the original document?
