  However, in November 2023, Ms. Doe read about a lawsuit filed against Mr. Combs by Casandra Ventura a/k/a “Cassie.” Ms. Ventura’s suit described a decade of physical, sexual and mental abuse. Most triggering for Ms. Doe was reading about Ms. Ventura’s allegations of sex trafficking and being forced to have sex with other men against her will. Ms. Doe obviously understands that she too had been sex trafficked, and that Mr. Combs’ behavior in forcing women into nonconsensual sex was not an isolated incident or unique only to Ms. Ventura.
