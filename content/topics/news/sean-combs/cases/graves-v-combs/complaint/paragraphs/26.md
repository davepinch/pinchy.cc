✂️: >-
  In or around the summer of 2001, Plaintiff received a call from Combs concerning her boyfriend’s employment at Bad Boy. He told her he wanted to meet with her in person to discuss her boyfriend’s supposed performance issues. Her boyfriend was determined to climb up the ladder at Combs’ records label and as his romantic partner, Plaintiff was committed to helping him. Plaintiff agreed to meet with Combs. In retrospect, it was evidently a sick and twisted way of using his ownership of and title at Bad Boy and its affiliate entities to abuse Plaintiff and also show his power and ability to humiliate her boyfriend, his executive.
