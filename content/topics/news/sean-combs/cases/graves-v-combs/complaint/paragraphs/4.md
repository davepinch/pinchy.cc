  Plaintiff never recovered from Defendants’ violent rape. She had suicidal thoughts and ideation and has received extensive psychological treatment because of Defendants’ attack. For decades, she remained silent and did not report the crime out of fear that Defendants would use their power to ruin her life, as they had repeatedly, explicitly threatened to do. To this day, Plaintiff suffers from severe depression, anxiety, and panic attacks, and still lives in fear of Defendants.
