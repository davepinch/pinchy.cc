✂️: >-
  Combs and Sherman drove Plaintiff to the Bad Boy studio in Manhattan. When they arrived and Plaintiff tried to get out of the car, she realized that she was feeling odd, and found it difficult to walk. She assumed this was her fault, and did her best to act normal, and followed Combs as he led her eventually to a couch in a private room in the Bad Boy studio. She later came to understand this was Combs’s personal lounge and office at the Bad Boy studio. Combs sat on the couch next to Plaintiff and continued speaking to her. Plaintiff began feeling even more woozy and sedated. She then lost consciousness.
