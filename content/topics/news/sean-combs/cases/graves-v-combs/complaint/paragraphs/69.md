✂️: >-
  The Combs Corporations enabled Combs and/or Sherman to commit the crime of violence motivated by gender because Combs and Sherman raped Plaintiff at the Bad Boy studio, where on information and belief they routinely committed sexual assault and gender-motivated violence, as detailed in other civil lawsuits. Given Combs’ and Sherman’s long-standing pattern and practice of committing sexual violence against women, including at the same location where they raped Plaintiff, the Combs Corporations had and/or should have had knowledge of Combs and Sherman using the premises for this unlawful conduct, and did nothing to stop it.
