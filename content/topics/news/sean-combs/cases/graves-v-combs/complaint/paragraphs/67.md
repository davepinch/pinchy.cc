✂️: >-
  The requirement that the crime of violence be committed because of gender or on the basis of gender, and due, at least in part, to an animus based on the victim’s gender is satisfied because Defendants Combs and Sherman violently forced Plaintiff to engage in vaginal intercourse, and oral and anal sex without her consent. Gender animus inheres when consent is absent. Moreover, Combs’ long history of violence against women evinces a deep contempt for women, as does Sherman’s alleged pattern of committing his own sexual assaults, recording them, and selling them as pornography.
