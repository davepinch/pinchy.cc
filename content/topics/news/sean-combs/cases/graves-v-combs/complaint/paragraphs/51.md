✂️: >-
  Earlier that month, Cassie Ventura had come forward and filed a lawsuit against Combs for subjecting her to years of severe sexual and physical abuse. The case had been settled one day after it had been filed. Plaintiff’s former boyfriend invoked Ms. Ventura’s effort to hold Combs’ accountable and for the first time confessed that years earlier, but sometime after the actual rape itself, Sherman and Combs had showed him and a group of men – some of whom were also employed by Combs’ companies and/or their related entities – the video of Plaintiff being raped. He disclosed that Combs and Sherman had a pattern and practice of non-consensually recording women engaging in sexual acts and making those videos available to the public, including by selling tapes as pornography. A Bad Boy artist later corroborated in a text message that Sherman “use[d] to sell porn of him doing this to chix” and that Sherman “did that to a lot of women.”
