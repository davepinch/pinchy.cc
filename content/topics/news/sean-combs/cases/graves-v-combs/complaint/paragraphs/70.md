✂️: >-
  The Combs Corporations enabled Combs and/or Sherman to commit the crime of violence motivated by gender by failing to, among other things, protect Plaintiff from a known danger and/or have sufficient policies and procedures in place to prevent sexual assault and/or train their employees on identifying and preventing sexual assault. Given Combs’ and Sherman’s long-standing pattern and practice of committing sexual violence against women, including on premises owned and/or operated by Defendants, the Combs Corporations had and/or should have had knowledge that Combs and Sherman were a danger to Plaintiff, and did nothing to stop Combs and Sherman.
