✂️: >-
  Plaintiff told close friends that Combs and Sherman had drugged and savagely raped her, but as noted was afraid to report the attack to the police out of fear that Defendants would follow through on their threats. She was even afraid to stay in New York City while Combs lived there, so with the help of a friend, she fled to Pennsylvania. Plaintiff has in fact relocated multiple times throughout the years in an effort to stay away from Combs.
