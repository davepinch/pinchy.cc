  On October 27, 2024, Hinchcliffe performed at a Donald Trump campaign rally in Madison Square Garden. During his set, he described Puerto Rico as a "floating island of garbage", and joked that "these Latinos, they love making babies, they do. There's no pulling out. They don't do that, they come inside, just like they do to our country".
