  The United States government group chat leak, also known as Signalgate, is a major political scandal in the United States involving the administration of President Donald Trump. From March 11 to 15, 2025, a group of United States national security leaders had a conversation on a group chat using the Signal messaging service about imminent military operations against the Houthis in Yemen. Among the chat's members were Vice President JD Vance, top White House staff, three Cabinet secretaries, and the directors of two Intelligence Community agencies. A high-profile leak occurred when National Security Advisor Mike Waltz erroneously added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of the American magazine The Atlantic and PBS weekly news program, Washington Week moderator, to the group. On March 15, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth used the chat to share sensitive and classified details of the impending airstrikes, including types of aircraft and missiles, as well as launch and attack times.[1][2] The name of an active undercover CIA officer was mentioned by CIA director John Ratcliffe in the chat,[3] while Vance and Hegseth expressed contempt for European allies.[4][5] Additionally, it has been reported that at around the same time, details about missile strikes in Yemen were shared to a second group chat which included his wife, his brother, and his lawyer.
