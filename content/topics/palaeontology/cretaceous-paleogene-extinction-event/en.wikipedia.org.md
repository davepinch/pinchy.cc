excerpt: >-
  The **Cretaceous–Paleogene** (**K–Pg**) extinction event, also known as the Cretaceous–Tertiary (K–T) extinction, was a sudden mass extinction of three-quarters of the plant and animal species on Earth, approximately 66 million years ago. The event caused the extinction of all non-avian dinosaurs. Most other tetrapods weighing more than 25 kilograms (55 pounds) also became extinct, with the exception of some ectothermic species such as sea turtles and crocodilians. It marked the end of the [Cretaceous](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous/) period, and with it the [Mesozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesozoic/) era, while heralding the beginning of the [Cenozoic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenozoic/) era, which continues to this day.
