  **Geography** (from Ancient Greek γεωγραφία *geōgraphía*; combining *gê* 'Earth' and *gráphō* 'write') is the study of the lands, features, inhabitants, and phenomena of [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/). Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of Earth and its human and natural complexities—not merely where objects are, but also how they have changed and come to be. While geography is specific to Earth, many concepts can be applied more broadly to other celestial bodies in the field of planetary science. Geography has been called "a bridge between natural science and social science disciplines."
