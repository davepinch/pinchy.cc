excerpt: >-
  A **continent** is any of several large geographical regions. Continents are generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria. A continent could be a single landmass or a part of a very large landmass, as in the case of [Asia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia/) or [Europe](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe/). Due to this, the number of continents varies; up to seven or as few as four geographical regions are commonly regarded as continents. Most English-speaking countries recognize seven regions as continents. In order from largest to smallest in area, these seven regions are Asia, [Africa](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa/), [North America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America/), [South America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America/), [Antarctica](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica/), Europe, and [Australia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_(continent)/). Different variations with fewer continents merge some of these regions; examples of this are merging North America and South America into America, Asia and Europe into Eurasia, and Africa, Asia, and Europe into Afro-Eurasia.
