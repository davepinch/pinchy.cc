excerpt: >-
  In atomic physics, the **Bohr model** or **Rutherfordâ€“Bohr model** is an obsolete model of the atom, presented by [Niels Bohr](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr/) and Ernest Rutherford in 1913. It consists of a small, dense nucleus surrounded by orbiting electrons. It is analogous to the structure of the [Solar System](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System/), but with attraction provided by electrostatic force rather than gravity, and with the electron energies quantized (assuming only discrete values).
