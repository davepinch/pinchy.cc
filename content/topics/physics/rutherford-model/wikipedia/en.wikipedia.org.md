excerpt: >-
  The **Rutherford model** was devised by Ernest Rutherford to describe an atom. Rutherford directed the Geigerâ€“Marsden experiment in 1909, which suggested, upon Rutherford's 1911 analysis, that J. J. Thomson's plum pudding model of the atom was incorrect. Rutherford's new model for the atom, based on the experimental results, contained new features of a relatively high central charge concentrated into a very small volume in comparison to the rest of the atom and with this central volume containing most of the atom's mass; this region would be known as the atomic nucleus. The Rutherford model was subsequently superseded by the [Bohr model](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model/).
