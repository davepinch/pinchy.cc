  **Mechanics** (from Ancient Greek: μηχανική, mēkhanikḗ, lit. "of machines") is the area of mathematics and physics concerned with the relationships between force, matter, and motion among physical objects. Forces applied to objects result in displacements or changes of an object's position relative to its environment.
