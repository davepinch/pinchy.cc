excerpt: >-
  In physics, the ***n*-body problem** is the problem of predicting the individual motions of a group of celestial objects interacting with each other gravitationally. Solving this problem has been motivated by the desire to understand the motions of the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun/), [Moon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon/), planets, and visible stars. In the 20th century, understanding the dynamics of globular cluster star systems became an important n-body problem. The n-body problem in general relativity is considerably more difficult to solve due to additional factors like time and space distortions.
