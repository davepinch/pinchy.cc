excerpt: >-
  In quantum mechanics, **Schrödinger's cat** is a thought experiment concerning quantum superposition. In the thought experiment, a hypothetical cat may be considered simultaneously both alive and dead, while it is unobserved in a closed box, as a result of its fate being linked to a random subatomic event that may or may not occur. This experiment viewed this way is described as a paradox. This thought experiment was devised by physicist [Erwin Schrödinger](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schrödinger/) in 1935 in a discussion with [Albert Einstein](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein/) to illustrate what Schrödinger saw as the problems of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.
