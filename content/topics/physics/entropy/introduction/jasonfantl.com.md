title: "What is Entropy? (jasonfantl.com)"
author: Jason Fantl
excerpt: >-
  People say many things about entropy: entropy increases with time, entropy is disorder, entropy increases with energy, entropy determines the arrow of time, etc.. But I have no idea what entropy is, and from what I find, neither do most other people. This is the introduction I wish I had when first told about entropy, so hopefully you find it helpful. My goal is that by the end of this long post we will have a rigorous and intuitive understanding of those statements, and in particular, why the universe looks different when moving forward through time versus when traveling backward through time.
