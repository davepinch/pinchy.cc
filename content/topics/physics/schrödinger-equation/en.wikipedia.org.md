excerpt: >-
  The **Schrödinger equation** is a linear partial differential equation that governs the wave function of a quantum-mechanical system. Its discovery was a significant landmark in the development of quantum mechanics. It is named after [Erwin Schrödinger](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schrödinger/), who postulated the equation in 1925 and published it in 1926, forming the basis for the work that resulted in his Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933.
