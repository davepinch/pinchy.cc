excerpt: >-
  **General relativity**, also known as the **general theory of relativity** and **Einstein's theory of gravity**, is the geometric theory of gravitation published by [Albert Einstein](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein/) in 1915 and is the current description of gravitation in modern physics. General relativity generalizes special relativity and refines [Newton](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton/)'s law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time or four-dimensional spacetime. In particular, the *curvature* of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of second order partial differential equations.
