excerpt: >-
  We float over a planet as white forms appear, dismembered. They work their way from the outside in, everything pointing to the centre. That is where they come from – the middle of you. As the pieces come together, forming a word denoting, in the most basic of terms, The Other, we are enveloped in a steady and dark tension.
