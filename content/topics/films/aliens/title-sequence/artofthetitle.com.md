excerpt: >-
  The sparse, soldiering snare drum opens to an almost digital yet organic titling, like the profile of some never before seen hive. The text, apparitional at first, seems to be gestating; the "I" blooms into a symbol of life and we are in the story with a masterful tilt down on the encroaching vessel. Fairly glorious.
