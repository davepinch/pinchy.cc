***Canon*** is a 1964 National Film Board of Canada animated short co-directed by [Norman McLaren](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_McLaren) and Grant Munro that offers a visual representation of the canon musical form through three animated segments. The soundtrack combines both a recorded classical score by Eldon Rathburn and electronic sounds produced via synthesizer.
