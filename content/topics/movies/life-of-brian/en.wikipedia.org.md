***Monty Python's Life of Brian*** (also known as ***Life of Brian***) is a 1979 British comedy film starring and written by the comedy group Monty Python (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, [Terry Gilliam](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Gilliam), Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin). It was directed by Jones. The film tells the story of Brian Cohen (played by Chapman), a young Jewish-Roman man who is born on the same day as—and next door to—[Jesus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus), and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah.
