excerpt: >-
  **Psilocybin** (/ˌsaɪləˈsaɪbɪn/ *sy-lə-SY-bin*, /ˌsɪl-/) is a naturally occurring psychedelic prodrug compound produced by more than 200 species of fungi. The most potent are members of genus *Psilocybe*, such as *P. azurescens*, *P. semilanceata*, and *P. cyanescens*, but psilocybin has also been isolated from about a dozen other genera. Psilocybin is itself biologically inactive but is quickly converted by the body to psilocin, which has mind-altering effects similar, in some aspects, to those of [lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide), [mescaline](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mescaline), and [dimethyltryptamine (DMT)](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine). In general, the effects include euphoria, visual and mental hallucinations, changes in perception, distorted sense of time, and perceived spiritual experiences. It can also cause adverse reactions such as nausea and panic attacks.
