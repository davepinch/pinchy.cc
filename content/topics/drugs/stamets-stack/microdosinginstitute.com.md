excerpt: >-
  The Paul Stamets Stack or stacking Lion’s Mane has quickly gained popularity in the microdosing community. Stacking refers to combining various non-psychoactive substances with a psychoactive microdosing substance to increase the benefit related to microdosing. Since renowned mycologist [Paul Stamets](/paul-stamets/) first mentioned this stacking combination, a large community of biohackers, microdosers and people looking to improve their brain health have adopted Stamets’ (now patented) microdosing stacking method.
