  **Fentanyl** is a potent synthetic piperidine opioid primarily used as an analgesic. It is 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine;[8] its primary clinical utility is in pain management for cancer patients and those recovering from painful surgeries. Fentanyl is also used as a sedative. Depending on the method of delivery, fentanyl can be very fast acting and ingesting a relatively small quantity can cause overdose. Fentanyl works by activating Î¼-opioid receptors. Fentanyl is sold under the brand names **Actiq**, **Duragesic** and **Sublimaze**, among others.
