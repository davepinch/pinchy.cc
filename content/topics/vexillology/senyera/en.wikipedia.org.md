  The **Senyera** (Eastern Calatan: [səˈɲeɾə]; meaning "pennon", "standard", "banner", "ensign", or, more generically, "flag" in Catalan) is a vexillological symbol based on the coat of arms of the Crown of Aragon, which consists of four red stripes on a yellow field. This coat of arms, often called *bars of Aragon*, or simply "the four bars", historically represented the King of the Crown of Aragon.
