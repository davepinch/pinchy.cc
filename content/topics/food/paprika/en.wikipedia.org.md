excerpt: >-
  **Paprika** (US /pəˈprikə/, /pæˈprikə/; UK /ˈpæprɪkə/, /pəˈpriːkə/) is a spice made from dried and ground red peppers. It is traditionally made from *Capsicum annuum* varietals in the Longum group, including chili peppers. Paprika can have varying levels of heat, but the chili peppers used for hot paprika tend to be milder and have thinner flesh than those used to produce chili powder. In some languages, but not English, the word paprika also refers to the plant and the fruit from which the spice is made, as well as to peppers in the Grossum group (e.g., bell peppers).
