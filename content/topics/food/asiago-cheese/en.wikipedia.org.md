> **Asiago** (UK: /ˌæsiˈɑːɡoʊ, ˌæzi-/ ASS-ee-AH-goh, AZ-, US: /ˌɑːsi-, ˌɑːʒi-, ˌɑːʃi-/ AH-s(h)ee-, AH-zhee-, Italian: [aˈzjaːɡo]) is a cow's milk cheese, first produced in Asiago in [Italy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy), that can assume different textures according to its aging, from smooth for the fresh Asiago (called Asiago Pressato, which means 'Pressed Asiago') to a crumbly texture for the aged cheese (Asiago d'allevo, which means 'Breeding farm Asiago'). The aged cheese is often grated in salads, soups, pastas, and sauces while the fresh Asiago is sliced to prepare panini or sandwiches; it can also be melted on a variety of dishes and cantaloupe. It is classified as a Swiss-type or Alpine cheese.
