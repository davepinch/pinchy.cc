title: "Castlevania II Simons Quest (castlevaniagames.net)"
excerpt: >-
  Locate the 5 pieces of Dracula then go to the ruins of Castle Dracula to defeat him and remove the curse. What curse you ask? So it turns out that at the end of Castlevania, Dracula placed a curse on poor Simon and now he has to find some way to remove it. Tough break eh? Castlevania II was released in 1987 and features some cool new features such as the day and night cycle. Enemies will be stronger at night so keep that in mind. The 5 body parts of Dracula can be found in 5 mansions and you will also need the Magic Cross (naturally). There are 3 different endings to this game depending on how quickly you beat it.
