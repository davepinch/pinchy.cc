excerpt: >-
  ***Frenzy*** is a multidirectional shooter arcade video game published by Stern Electronics in 1982. It is a direct sequel to Berzerk; both games were developed by Alan McNeil. Frenzy's gameplay is very similar to Berzerk—the player enters a series of maze-like rooms containing armed robots and must shoot them to survive—but adds more variety. Ports were released for ColecoVision and ZX Spectrum.
