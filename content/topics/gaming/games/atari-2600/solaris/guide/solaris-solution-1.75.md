excerpt: >-
  I remember when I was a kid and Solaris was one of those games that I had bought with my own money. I proudly inserted it into my Atari 2600 I knew right away that this game was different from the rest. It had a plot, a goal and an ending; something that was a rarity for Atari games. I was immediately fascinated and after reading the instruction manual, something I always did, I was determined to finish the game. I spent hours on my living room floor happily drawing maps by hand on graph paper and trying to reach Solaris. I never did, but the strategic game play was so good that I actually enjoyed failing and didn’t get frustrated. Time passed. I never forgot this game and over the years I would keep coming back, each time more determined to finish it. Now, decades later, the internet has finally given me the tools I needed to complete this amazing game. I have made this guide so that others can do the same.
