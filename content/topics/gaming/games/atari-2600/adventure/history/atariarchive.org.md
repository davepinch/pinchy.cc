  Of all the original games Atari put out for the VCS, *Adventure* may be the one that most people are familiar with today. Warren Robinett’s third and final VCS game – though seemingly the second to actually be released – serves as a counterweight to the arcade action of its March 1980 brethren *Space Invaders* by providing a nearly unique experience on a home console in its day.
