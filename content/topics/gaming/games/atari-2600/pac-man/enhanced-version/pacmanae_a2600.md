enhanced version of: Pac-Man (Atari 2600)
excerpt: >-
  Everyone's familiar with the now infamous version of Pac-Man that Atari unleashed to its legions of 2600 fans. If you've ever wished for a version of Pac-Man truer to the original, Rob Kudla has modified the much better Ms. Pac-Man and turned it into the Pac-Man Atari should have released. This is a fairly significant hack, and here are the changes Rob made to Ms. Pac-Man: Changed the graphics Altered the theme music Changed audio code to improve authenticity Changed playfield color and layout Got rid of extra tunnel and three extra mazes Made fruit sit in the middle of the screen without moving Added the siren If you're a Pac-Man fan, you owe it to yourself to get this version!
