emulator of: Asteroids (Atari 2600)
excerpt: >-
  Based off the wildly popular 1979 arcade game. The object of the game is to destroy as many asteroid boulders as possible and keep your ship in space as long as possible. Use your Joystick Controller to maneuver your ship through space and press the red controller(fire) button to shoot photon torpedoes at the asteroid boulders. When an asteroid is hit, it may just break up into smaller boulders, or it may be completely pulverized. In some game variations you'll face additional space hazards such as satellites and UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects); both of which may be firing torpedoes at you.
note: The screenshot on the Internet Archive page is incorrect. However, pressing the start button will correctly load the Asteroids game.
