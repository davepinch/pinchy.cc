excerpt: >-
  **FastDoom** is a source port created by VÃ­ctor Nieto (Viti95). Its goal is to improve the performance of the vanilla Doom engine on lower end computer systems, in particular the 386 and 486 class of processors. It does so by removing features deemed unnecessary, reducing rendering complexity and general engine optimization.
