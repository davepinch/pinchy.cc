classic refined source of: DOOM
excerpt: >-
  DOOM Retro is the classic, refined DOOM source port for Windows PC. It represents how I like my DOOM to be today, in all its dark and gritty, unapologetically pixelated glory. I have strived to craft a unique and cohesive set of compelling features, while continuing to uphold my respect for that classic, nostalgic DOOM experience many of us, after all this time, still hold dear.
