author: William Shakespeare (Wikipedia)
excerpt: >-
  **"The lady doth protest too much, methinks"** is a line from the play Hamlet by William Shakespeare. It is spoken by Queen Gertrude in response to the insincere overacting of a character in the play within a play created by Prince Hamlet to elicit evidence of his uncle's guilt in the murder of his father, the King of Denmark.
