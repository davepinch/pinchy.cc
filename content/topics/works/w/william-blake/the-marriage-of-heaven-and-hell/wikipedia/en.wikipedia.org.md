  ***The Marriage of Heaven and Hell*** is a book by the English poet and printmaker [William Blake](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake). It is a series of texts written in imitation of biblical prophecy but expressing Blake's own intensely personal Romantic and revolutionary beliefs. Like his other books, it was published as printed sheets from etched plates containing prose, poetry, and illustrations. The plates were then coloured by Blake and his wife Catherine.
