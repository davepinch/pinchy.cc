excerpt: >-
  As of now, 15 September 2023, the comic book property called Fables, including all related Fables spin-offs and characters, is now in the public domain. What was once wholly owned by Bill Willingham is now owned by everyone, for all time. Itâ€™s done, and as most experts will tell you, once done it cannot be undone. Take-backs are neither contemplated nor possible.
