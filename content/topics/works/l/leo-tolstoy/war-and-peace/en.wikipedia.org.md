  ***War and Peace*** (Russian: Война и мир, romanized: *Voyna i mir*; pre-reform Russian: Война и миръ; [vɐjˈna i ˈmʲir]) is a literary work by the Russian author Lev Tolstoy. Set during the Napoleonic Wars, the work comprises both a fictional narrative and chapters in which Tolstoy discusses history and philosophy. An early version was published serially beginning in 1865, after which the entire book was rewritten and published in 1869. It is regarded, with *Anna Karenina*, as Tolstoy's finest literary achievement, and it remains an internationally praised classic of world literature.
