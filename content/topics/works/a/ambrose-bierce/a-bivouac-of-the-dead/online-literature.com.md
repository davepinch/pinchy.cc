battle site of: Battle of Camp Allegheny
excerpt: >-
  Away up in the heart of the Allegheny mountains, in Pocahontas county, West Virginia, is a beautiful little valley through which flows the east fork of the Greenbrier river. At a point where the valley road intersects the old Staunton and Parkersburg turnpike, a famous thoroughfare in its day, is a post office in a farm house. The name of the place is Travelers' Repose, for it was once a tavern. Crowning some low hills within a stone's throw of the house are long lines of old Confederate fortifications, skilfully designed and so well"preserved"that an hour's work by a brigade would put them into serviceable shape for the next civil war. This place had its battle--what was called a battle in the"green and salad days"of the great rebellion.
