  [William Alloway] Slaughter had gone to Olympia for two or three days, and I was acting as quartermaster during his absence. The captain had discovered that some Post mules were in use by a farmer, and he came to me and ordered them to be brought in. I replied that I did not know Mr. Slaughter's arrangements concerning the mules, and therefore did not like to interfere. He turned to me and said sharply: "You will do it, By G-- if I order you to," whereupon I answered in the same tone: "I won't do it, by G--, unless you do." He at once changed his tone and manner and said the he had meant it as an order, and naturally I answered that IF that were the case I would obey him.
