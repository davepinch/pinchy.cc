  June 5th [of 1853]. We sailed across the Straits of Fuca heading for the north end of Whidby island, where we expected to go through Deception passage. The wind carried us within a few miles of Deception pass and then died away, so that we were obliged to resort to the oars. The tide being at its ebb, the guide said it was impossible to get through, so we went into camp in a small cove north of the entrance...Deception pass is a narrow channel between Whidby and Fidalgo islands. Its existence is connected with fearful stories of whirlpools and eddies, and it is only at the flood or ebb of the tide, when the waters are said to be quiet, that it is possible to go through with any safety.
