  We returned by way of Point Wilson, in order to see a stratum of what Mr. Hastings called "ignite." We failed to see any bear, of which there were many indications, but we killed a few grouse and Dr. Haden wounded a large eagle, which I was foolish enough to approach. He attacked me fiercely, sinking his bill and claws firmly into my leg, causing intense pain. I was only released after I had cut his head off with my knife.
