  A day or two after my arrival I went down to the mouth of the creek which gives its name to the post and the locality, and had my first sight of the Sound. Two gentlemen from the post were with me, and I could not control my admiration at the beauty of the scene. The tide was flood and the limpid waters reproduced the fir-clad shores. The snow-clad Olympics were in full view, and clear air enabled us to see far into the Narrows. I found out afterward that only on exceptional days in winter could this effect be seen.
