  Mr. [Charles Carroll] Terry was the town proprietor of New York [Alki], which never grew beyond one house. The first settlers of Seattle located there. They soon moved over to Yesler's saw mill, on Elliott Bay, and with that for a center, they radiated along the shore, into the woods and over the hills to Lake Washington, laying the foundation of the Queen City of the Sound. We crossed over to Seattle on the 25th before continuing on our way, and there we saw the saw mill and a few blockhouses for the mill hands. These were situated several blocks back from the wharf line of the city, as established after the great fire of 1889.
