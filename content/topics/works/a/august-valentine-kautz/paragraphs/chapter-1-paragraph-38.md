  This evening I paid my respects to the lords of the country. There were also some distinguished Americans among their number. "Gen. Taylor" showed a letter of recommendation he had received from Moses^16^, post collector; "John C. Calhoun" sold to us a pretty little canoe for the sum of $5.50 which we proposed to use as a tender to our launch in shallow water. The "Duke of Clarence" has stretched my bearskin for me.
