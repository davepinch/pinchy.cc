  Early on the morning of the 10th we left Whatcom. The tide was with us, but the wind was against us, and it was 11 o'clock before we lost sight of Whatcom. We lunched in a beautiful little cove on Lummi island, which forms the southwest boundary of the [Bellingham] bay. The wind lulled, but, the tide favoring us, we continued on our course, entered the grand canal of the Swinomish [Slough] and succeeded in reaching our camp of the 6th near the same Indian camp.
