  The 30th [May 1853]. was spent in visitng old man Crockett, who with a large family was located on the prairie on the top of Admiralty head. A large number of Suqualmish Indians engaged in gathering camas were encamped on the bay.^17^ From them the doctor [John Miller Haden] and [Edmond] Starling succeeded in procuring transporation to Steilacoom. For this reason the doctor and Starling had come to the island with me. They were prettily fooled by Col. Eby, on whom they expected to impose, as the colonel was going to Olympia to assume his office as successor to [Abram Benton] Moses, and they planned to return at his expense.
