  On the morning of the 28th, therefore, we ran across to Col. Eby's and camped on the beach under the bluff on which his house is situated. We found him at home looking the pioneer that he was. He wore an old hickory shirt, trousers rent completely across the knees, which had been patched before, and on his head a most shocking bad hat. He entertained us liberally for the three days that we camped near him. Whidby island in its wild state was and still is wonderfully beautiful and rich. The only obstacle to settlement was the absence of water, as there was not a running stream on the island. The whole is over fifty miles long, and raised about 200 feet above sea level.
