  Fort Nesqually^4^, the Hudson Bay trading post, was about seven miles to the south [of Fort Steilacoom]. Several farmers had taken donation claims^5^ on a few known fertile spots within a few miles of the fort on the Nesqually plains. The buildings were very primitive, being built of logs of small fir saplings with the bark on. The chincks were daubed with clay, which constituted the interior finish.
