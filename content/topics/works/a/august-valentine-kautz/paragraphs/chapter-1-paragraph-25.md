  We concocted a chowder this evening. Potatoes, clams, fish and onions formed the ingredients, and we all had good appetite. The great quantity and variety of sea fruit to be found in the Sound and the facility with which they are obtained is a feature of the country which is very attractive. It must be especially so to the poor man, as he need never want for food. As one of the ledgers at this place expressed it,"When the tide is out the table is spread."^14^
