  Fortunately I had some of the venison from a buck the doctor had killed. The clams are accessible to us as well as to the Indians, besides which among our regular supplies we have bread, coffee and sugar. The Indians themselves live mainly on salmon and clams. They have a few potato patches, and I presume they also kill some game, but although it is quite abundant, it is very difficult to get on account of the timber.
