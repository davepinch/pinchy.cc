  May 29th [of 1853]. The doctor [John Miller Haden] and I, piloted by Col. Eby, tramped to a little settlement on Penn's cove, called Coveland. Here Capt. Boscoe and Dr. Lansdale were holding claims preparatory to the inauguration of a big city, which, however, can only be realized after they have provided a water supply for the future occupants. Dr. Lansdale lives in a little hut on the edge of the prairie at the head of the cove. Capt. Boscoe was building a trading store.
