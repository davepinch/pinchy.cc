  On the 7th [June 1853] we drifted into Padilla bay. Here we ran aground several times and I was obliged to hire another Indian pilot. We did not make more than ten miles, and camped in a little cove on one of the islands, probably Guymas. In the twilight I paddled about the base of the cliffs in our little canoe and admired the deep blue of the waters and the grandeur of the rocks. On the 8th we reached Whatcom.
