  He [DeLancy Floyd-Jones] was very youthful in appearance and had pleasant manners, except for a certain absent-mindedness, which often made him appear rude. He had received his brevet of captain for gallant and meritorious conduct at Molino del Ray in the war with Mexico. He retired after thirty years of service, and having made investments in Chicago that gave him a competency, he is able to live at the Union club, New York. He was rather devoid of tact. I remember a matter which caused him to have strained relations with Slaughter, and nearly brought about an issue between my brevet captain and myself.
