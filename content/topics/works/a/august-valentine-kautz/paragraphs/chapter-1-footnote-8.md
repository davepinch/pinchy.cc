  Fort Vancouver had been founded as a Hudson's Bay Company post as early as 1825 and was still partually occupied by them. The U.S. Army post originally occupied space which was leased from the Company. It was first called Columbia Barracks and on July 13, 1853 it became known as Fort Vancouver. The name of the post was changed to Vancouver Barracks on April 5, 1879. (Frazer, p. 176-177.).
