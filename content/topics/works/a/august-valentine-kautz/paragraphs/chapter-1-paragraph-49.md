  On the lst of June we camped on the mainland at the house of a Mr. Garish, to whom I had received a letter from Mr. Starling. We desired to go on to Dungeness, but Garish persuaded us to stay with him arguing that there were no whites at Dungeness, that there was no water and that the Indians had gone fishing. Before I left I. found that he had not represented the facts correctly, and that I should have gone to Dungeness. Garish had a store and he probably thought that he could get some trade out of us. I stayed four nights at this camp and during that time I saw much of the Indians, but as usual there was nothing wrong. There had been no liquor^18^ sold to the Indians since Spencer, then in the guard house at Steilacoom, had been apprehended.
