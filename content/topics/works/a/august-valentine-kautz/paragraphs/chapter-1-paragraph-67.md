  Lummi Indians - June 9th [of 1853]. Accompanied by Goliah, I visited the mouth of the Lummi, where the headquarters of the Lummi band is supposed to be. We had our little canoe, and, the wind rising, we became quite wet, so that we decided to get out and walk. At the first mouth I found a settler named Hedge. He was living in a house of mats, like the Indians. He had an Indian wife with him and a white wife in the States. He had a great deal to tell me, most of which I do not believe. He boasts of his claim and praises the richness of the valley, which, however, he has not explored. He claims to have a great control over the Indians, and tells me that Chowitzan, chief of the Lummis, having heard of my coming and fearing that I might be after him, had gone to Victoria.^21^
