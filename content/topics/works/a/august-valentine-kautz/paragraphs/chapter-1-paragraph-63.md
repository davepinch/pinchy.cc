  In order to lull suspicion, I decided not to attempt a capture immediately, but to await our return from Bellingham bay. We started in the afternoon and were carried almost through the Swinomish slough. This is a natural canal through the tide flats, several hundred feet wide and about twenty feet deep. At high tide large boats are able to go through. The country is principally inhabited by Swinomish and Skagit Indians. White men have not yet thought of settling on these rich flats, which will certainly become very valuable on account of their productiveness.
