  We rowed across in an hour and landed on the beach at Hasting's store. I expected to get information at this point in regard to violations of the intercourse, but like all rumors, the location shifts, as you seem to approach it. I am told that the depredations and violations of the law were not committed here, but elsewhere. There are many Indian lodges on the sandspit, but their inmates have gone fishing. I shall stay over a day or two, however, and see what I can learn.
