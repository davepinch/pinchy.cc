  Clarence Bagley in writing an introduction for the "Journal of Occurrences at Nisqually House, 1833" for the Washington Historical Quarterly gives a good account of Fort Nisqually: "Fort Nisqually was the first permanent settlement of white men on Puget Sound. Fort Vancouver had been headquarters since 1825 and Fort Langley was founded near the mouth of the Fraser river in 1827. Fort Nisqually was, therefore, a station which served to link these two together.
  "While the primary object of the Hudson's Bay Company was to collect furs, nevertheless, the great needs of their own trappers, and the needs of Russian America(Alaska), and the Hawaiian Islands and other places for foodstuffs, caused that the Company branch out into other lines....
  "A subsidiary company, the Puget Sound Agricultural Company, was formed in 1838 for the purposes of taking advantage of the agricultural opportunities of the Pacific...From that time Fort Nisqually became more an agricultural enterprise than a furtrading post."
