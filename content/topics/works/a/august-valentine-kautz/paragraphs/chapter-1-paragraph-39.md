  These Indians are of the Clallam tribe. They all claim to be chiefs, and their names have been given to them by the whites. A man named Hancock, of Port Townsend, gave me some information concerning an old man named Church, who had been killed on Whidby Island. He believed the Indians had killed & the Indians claim that he was killed by a Kikealis. I was told also that Col. Eby, the newly appointed collector of the post, can give me some definite knowledge, as he was on the coroner's inquest. The colonel lives directly opposite on Whidby island. His residence is visible, as it is only six miles across the straits at this point.
