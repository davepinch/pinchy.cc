✂️: >-
  I was introduced to the Duke of York^19^ and Lord Jim, both of whom are superior to any Indians I have yet met. An old man named Larkinum was chief of the Clallams, but he abdicated in favor of his son, the Duke. Lord Jim is very intelligent and can speak English quite well. He took a great deal of pride in showing me some papers he had received from different whites, principally sea captains. I was much amused at their contents for most of them abused him without reserve, calling him a liar, a thief, a drunkard and a gambler. Some of them were curious literary productions, abounding in flowers of speech. Lord Jim, of course, imagined these certificates of his rascality to contain nothing but praise, and begged me to add mine to the number, which, I think, will help him as much as any of the others. I procured a Skagit Indian named Goliah to act as guide. I think he will do well.
