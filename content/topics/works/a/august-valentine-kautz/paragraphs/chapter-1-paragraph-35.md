✂️: >-
  May 27th [of 1853]. We went on a walking expedition today over to the straits. Here we found the claim of a Mr. Ross, his wife and son. I could see no sense in his location, for although the timber is fine there is no market for it; that is, no mill at hand, and he has no cattle to haul it and no pasture to feed the cattle. The extent of his farm is a productive garden which he has planted on an old Indian camping ground.
author: August Valentine Kautz
chapter: 1
mention of:
  - Strait of Juan de Fuca
  - Benjamin Ross
note: He likely means Strait of Juan de Fuca, which north of Port Townsend past Point Wilson. He mentions returning via Point Wilson in the next paragraph. Regarding Mr. Ross, Benjamin Ross is a possible candidate because he was in the vicinity at the time.
