  A fair breeze springing up, we decided to take advantage of it, and after a delightful sail we reached New York [Alki] at midnight and pitched camp. The following day we passed to the east of Vashon island, but wind and tide being against us, we did not reach the mouth of Steilacoom creek until 1 that night.
