✂️: >-
  During the spring I met many of the old pioneers. Dr. Tolmie, the thrifty Scotch manager of the Hudson Bay Co. at Fort Nesqually, and I formed a friendship and our acquaintance, which was kept up by letter when separated, lasted until he died. His assistant, Mr. Huggins, was also to be found in the doctor's household in those days. He remained on American territory when the company relinquished their rights to the United States, and has for years been one of the reliable and hard-working officials of his county.
