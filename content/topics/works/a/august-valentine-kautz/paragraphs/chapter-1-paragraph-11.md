  The months of April and May, 1853, passed rapidly, and are full of pleasant memories of hunting, riding, fishing, and making friends. I was able to save a little money out of my pay, as eatables were more abundant and cheaper than in Vancouver^8^, where the mess bill consumed nearly my entire pay. There was a fine post garden, from which we had a large supply of rejected potatoes that we fell heir to, from the artillery. They were too small for our use, but the Indians were fond of them, and brought us all the clams, fish and game we wanted in exchange for the little tubers.
