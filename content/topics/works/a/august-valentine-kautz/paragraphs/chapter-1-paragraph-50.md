  Visit to Clallam. - The Indians at this place are more primitive than those at the head of the Sound. They are less nomadic and have seen little of the whites and crowded with great curiosity about our camp. They have no range, except on the water, for the country behind is quite impenetrable. Their abodes are permanent, for they live in extensive houses, reminding me of the tobacco sheds in the east. They are formed of large posts, supporting beams, some of them so large that it is a source of wonder how they are handled. The sides and roofs are formed o[ut] of huge slabs of cedar fastened together with strong twigs. An elliptical hole through one of these slabs forms the door, and often the entrance consists of a passage-way of rough boards.
