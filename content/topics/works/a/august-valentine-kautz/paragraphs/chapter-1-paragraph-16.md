  The [Steilacoom] site was very fine for a city, with a good roadstead, but its ambitious beginning was rudely curtained into a suburb of Tacoma, which did not spring up until twenty years later. The congress that closed on the 3rd of March, 1853, had created the Territory of Washington, and President Pierce appointed I.I.Stevens, an ex-army officer, Governor. The new administration made many removals, among them Judge Strong, and Agent Starling. The news of the changes did not come to us until early in the month of May, and were matters of great moment to the people.
