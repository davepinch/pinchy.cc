  Our camp is located on a piece of lowland covered with grass, but behind us is a high bank. This is a camping ground for the Indians who travel up and down the Sound, down which the bear had come to take his bath. The point probably takes its name from the fact that at high water the point is hidden from view. Fortunately the beach is sandy, for after dark the north wind prevailed and the boat was driven ashore; if the bottom had been rocky it would have been injured or possibly ruined.

camp location: Kitsap Peninsula
note:
  - If examined with satellite view, this area is sandy. See Bing Maps.
