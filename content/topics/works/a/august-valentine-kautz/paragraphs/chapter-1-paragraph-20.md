   In May [of 1853] I was supplied with an open ships launch with two sails and a month's supplies for a sergeant, ten men and a guide, and informed that the object of the expedition was to "intimidate the Indians." When the strength of my command is considered in connection with the hordes of Indians then to be found along the shores of the waters of Puget Sound, the absurdity of this order becomes apparent. This is more evident now than it was then, for at the time our mission seemed to partake merely of danger, and not of folly. Also my orders were very undefined: I was to visit the various settlements and to do all in my power to discover the offenders and the source of complaints. I was given authority to arrest whites who were selling liquor to Indians and full license to arrest Indians on suspicion. So on the 23rd of May, 1853, we started on our voyage of “intimidation" accompanied by Dr. Haden and Mr. Starling, the agent who had proposed to go part of the way.
