  May 26th. We started at 5 after some trouble in shoving the boat off the beach, where the tide had left her. As we had the tide with us, we found that we should have no difficulty in reaching our destination (Port Townsend), so we stopped at Marrowstone point and leisurely took our lunch. Starling claimed to be a man of experience, and when we started across Port Townsend bay he insisted that we should sail. None of us were sailors, so we differed with him and judged that the quickest means was rowing. Starling worked the sails for about an hour without any effect. He would not yield, although we laughed and argued, but finally suggested that there was nothing to prevent my furling the sails, if I wanted to.
