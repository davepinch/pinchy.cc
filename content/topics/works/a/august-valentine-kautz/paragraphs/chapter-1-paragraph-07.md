✂️: >-
  My relations with my fellow-officers were pleasant. Lieut. Jones, my first commanding officer, whom I should more properly speak of as Floyd Jones, had a number of peculiarities, but was on the whole a good commanding officer. He was a man of good habits, and very reputable in his personal conduct. We only differed on one subject. He affected too much devotion to the conventionalities of aristocracy and family inheritance. He laid claim to blue blood himself, and maintained that small hands and small feet were a sign of good lineage. He was conspicuous for being the only man in the country who changed his shirt every day, which, in those days, certainly exhibited unpardonable pride.
