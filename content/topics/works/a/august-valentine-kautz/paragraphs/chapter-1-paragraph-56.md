  I met but few whites, as they did not seem to have settled in that vicinity. Mr. Garish introduced me to his partner, a Mr. Powell, who had been away "log-raising" for a new house at Squim bay.^20^ Powell was a man of adventure. He has been ship-wrecked on Vancouver's island and had been captured by the Indians, so that his conversation was very interesting. Capt. Moore, a settler at Dungeness, impressed me favorably as an honest man. He corrected some of the erroneous impressions I had received from Garish, and showed himself very anxious to supress the contraband trade with the Indians.
