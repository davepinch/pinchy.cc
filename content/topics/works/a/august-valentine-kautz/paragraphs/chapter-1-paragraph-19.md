  In April a number of reports of trouble with the Indians were sent to the commanding officer from the settlements along the lower Sound^10^. White men had disappeared and were supposed to have been killed by Indians. The sale of liquor to Indians was a great source of trouble, and information of this illegal trade was also furnished, so that Capt. Jones finally decided to dispatch me with a small detachment on a trip of investigation.
