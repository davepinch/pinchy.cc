  Judge Strong, who was one of the territorial judges, always came to the post on his trips to hold court. He lived on the Columbia. Starling was the Indian agent. Moses was collector of the post, and lived at Olympia. Goldsborough, Mason, Simmons, in fact, all of the first pioneers were seen at the post frequently during the few months of my tour of duty. Steilacoom was the place where the vessels landed, and it was called a city, although there were only a few houses. Dr. Webber had a store and dealt in lumber. Mr. John M. Chapman had taken the best of the ground for the town and Lafayette Balch had taken a claim adjoining to the north, and was in partnership, too, with Webber.
