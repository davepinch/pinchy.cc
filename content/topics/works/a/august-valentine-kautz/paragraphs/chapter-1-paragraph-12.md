  Peter Smith in after years took up a donation claim on this spot, and as the garden was never reserved, he fell heir to it when the post was broken up. I started a small garden myself on the border of the little lake half a mile south of the post, and when I needed exercise I obtained it there. I rode over the sparsely settled plains in search of grouse and ducks and other game and went fishing in the Sound or in Steilacoom creek with the officers, but most frequently alone.
