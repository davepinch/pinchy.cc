  After bidding my friends goodbye, I sailed away for Dungeness. Soon after rounding Protection point the wind went down, and we had hard work to reach Protection island, where we camped. There is no water on the island, but fortunately we had two buckets full, which we had brought with us. There are no inhabitants, except some hogs, which seem to thrive very well. The island is composed of sandbanks, which recede from the water's edge and form a little valley in the center. On the east side is a strip of fir timber and sufficient soil to produce a coat of grass interspersed with fern.
