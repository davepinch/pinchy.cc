  June 4th [of 1853]. Hunting. On the 4th I spent the day hunting...I. passed through the tide prairies east of camp, through the timber onto a large gravelly prairie. Here I saw abundant signs of bear, deer, elk and moose, but as they could only be found in the timber I proceeded to the southern border, where the ground ascended one of the foothills of the Olympics.
