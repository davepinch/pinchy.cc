   During the short period of arrest several canoes had departed with Indians who had promised to bring Sla-hai. But they returned in the evening without the prisoner. An Indian named Charley, in whom Fay had great reliance, told a long and what was intended to be a thrilling story of how he failed to get Sla-hai. The reason he failed was because Sla-hai's brother frightened him away with a pistol, but Charley was much disappointed that we did not get excited over his recital, and he cooled off very suddenly.
