✂️: >-
  Fort Steilacoom was an ex-sheep ranch of the Puget Sound Agricultural Co., an off-shoot of the Hudson Bay Co., being no longer needed, was gladly leased to the Quartermaster's Department for the use of the troops.^1^ Bennett Hill's Co. of the First Artillery was the first to occupy it and we were his successors with Company C. of the Fourth Infrantry.^2^ The location was on the plain which is now the site of the Insane Asylum, and has many advantages.^3^ The soil was level and hard and had produced some magnificent oak trees on the edge of the parade ground overshadowing the officers' quarters.
