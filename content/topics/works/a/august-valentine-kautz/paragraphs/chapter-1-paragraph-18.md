  I wrote a few letters to the New York Herald and the Spirit of the Times, but this was only a fraction of what I desired and mentally resolved to do. I soon realized that army life in garrison was one of laziness. It soon required effort to hunt or ride on the plains or to go fishing. But this discouraging condition was happily interrupted first by a detail of an absorbing nature and then by my promotion, which caused my removal.
