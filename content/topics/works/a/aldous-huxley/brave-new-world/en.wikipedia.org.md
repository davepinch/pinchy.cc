excerpt: >-
  ***Brave New World*** is a dystopian novel by English author [Aldous Huxley](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley), written in 1931 and published in 1932. Largely set in a futuristic World State, whose citizens are environmentally engineered into an intelligence-based social hierarchy, the novel anticipates huge scientific advancements in reproductive technology, sleep-learning, psychological manipulation and classical conditioning that are combined to make a dystopian society which is challenged by the story's protagonist. Huxley followed this book with a reassessment in essay form, *Brave New World Revisited* (1958), and with his final novel, *Island* (1962), the utopian counterpart. This novel is often compared to [George Orwell](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell)'s *[Nineteen Eighty-Four](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four)* (1949).
