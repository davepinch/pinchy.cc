excerpt: >-
  ***The Doors of Perception*** is an autobiographical book written by [Aldous Huxley](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley). Published in 1954, it elaborates on his psychedelic experience under the influence of mescaline in May 1953. Huxley recalls the insights he experienced, ranging from the "purely aesthetic" to "sacramental vision", and reflects on their philosophical and psychological implications. In 1956, he published *Heaven and Hell*, another essay which elaborates these reflections further. The two works have since often been published together as one book; the title of both comes from William Blake's 1793 book *The Marriage of Heaven and Hell*.
