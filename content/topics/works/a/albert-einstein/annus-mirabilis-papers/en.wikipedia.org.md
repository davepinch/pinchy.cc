excerpt: >-
  The **annus mirabilis papers** (from Latin *annus mīrābilis*, "miracle year") are the four papers that [Albert Einstein](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein/) published in Annalen der Physik (Annals of Physics), a scientific journal, in 1905. These four papers were major contributions to the foundation of modern physics. They revolutionized science's understanding of the fundamental concepts of space, time, mass, and energy. Because Einstein published these remarkable papers in a single year, 1905 is called his annus mirabilis (miracle year in English or Wunderjahr in German).
