  For instance, directors often puzzle about the “Where are all these corpses from?” section in Act Two: What the *hell* are these guys talking about?  What does it mean?  Beckett’s notebook specifies that they have suddenly seen *the audience* and are horrified.  It’s a gag.  It’s a dig at the audience.  What it’s not is an Intellectual Mountain.  Much of the fog in the more mystical sections clears away when you can say, “Hello!  It’s a joke!”
