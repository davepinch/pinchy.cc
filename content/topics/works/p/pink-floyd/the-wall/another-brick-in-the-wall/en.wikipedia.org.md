excerpt: >-
  **"Another Brick in the Wall"** is a three-part composition on [Pink Floyd](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd)'s 1979 rock opera *[The Wall](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall)*, written by bassist Roger Waters. "Part 2", a protest song against corporal punishment, and rigid and abusive schooling, features a children's choir. At the suggestion of producer Bob Ezrin, Pink Floyd added elements of disco.
"RISE STRONG": 'Bassist Roger Waters wrote "Part 2" as a protest against rigid schooling, particularly boarding schools. "Another Brick in the Wall" appears in the film based on the album. In the "Part 2" sequence, children enter a school and march in unison through a meat grinder, becoming "putty-faced" clones, before rioting and burning down the school.'
