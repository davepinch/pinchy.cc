excerpt: >-
  ***Rights of Man*** (1791), a book by [Thomas Paine](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine), including 31 articles, posits that popular political revolution is permissible when a government does not safeguard the natural rights of its people. Using these points as a base it defends the French Revolution against Edmund Burke's attack in *Reflections on the Revolution in France* (1790).
