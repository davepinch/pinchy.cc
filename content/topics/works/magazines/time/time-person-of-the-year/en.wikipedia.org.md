excerpt: >-
  **Person of the Year** (called **Man of the Year** or **Woman of the Year** until 1999) is an annual issue of the American news magazine and website *Time* featuring a person, a group, idea, or object that "for better or for worse... has done the most to influence the events of the year". The editors select the featured subject, though the *Time* website or a partner organization also runs an annual reader's poll that has no effect on the selection.
