  To many, The Strand is synonymous with Sherlock Holmes.  Founded in 1891 and edited by George Newnes, The Strand was a general-interest magazine, offering fiction, humor, current events, political satire, celebrity biographies and more.  Sherlock Holmes made his first appearance in The Strand in 1891, and much of Doyle’s other fiction also appears in these volumes, along with fiction by many of the world’s best-known authors, such as Mark Twain, Jules Verne, Bret Harte, etc.  The magazine was also noted for its extensive use of photography, which led to an increased demand for stories about “curiosities” from around the world that could be illustrated with photos.  Monthly issues were compiled into 6-month bound volumes running from January-June and July-December.
