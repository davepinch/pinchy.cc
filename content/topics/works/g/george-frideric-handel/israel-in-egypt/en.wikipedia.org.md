  ***Israel in Egypt***, HWV 54, is a biblical oratorio by the composer George Frideric Handel. Most scholars believe the libretto was prepared by Charles Jennens, who also compiled the biblical texts for Handel's Messiah. It is composed entirely of selected passages from the [Old Testament](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament/), mainly from Exodus and the Psalms.
