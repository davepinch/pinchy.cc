excerpt: >-
  "**Frank Sinatra Has a Cold**" is a profile of [Frank Sinatra](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra/) written by Gay Talese for the April 1966 issue of Esquire. The article is one of the most famous pieces of magazine journalism ever written and is often considered not only the greatest profile of Frank Sinatra but one of the greatest celebrity profiles ever written. The profile is one of the seminal works of New Journalism and is still widely read, discussed and studied. In the 70th anniversary issue of Esquire in October 2003, the editors declared the piece the "Best Story Esquire Ever Published". Vanity Fair called it "the greatest literary-nonfiction story of the 20th century". The illustrations that accompanied the original article were made by Edward Sorel, who also did the artwork for the Esquire issue's front cover.
