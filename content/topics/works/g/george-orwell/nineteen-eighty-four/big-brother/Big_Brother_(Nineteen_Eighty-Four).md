excerpt: >-
  **Big Brother** is a fictional character and symbol in [George Orwell](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell/)'s dystopian 1949 novel [Nineteen Eighty-Four](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four/). He is ostensibly the leader of Oceania, a totalitarian state wherein the ruling party, Ingsoc, wields total power "for its own sake" over the inhabitants. In the society that Orwell describes, every citizen is under constant surveillance by the authorities, mainly by telescreens (with the exception of the Proles). The people are constantly reminded of this by the slogan "Big Brother is watching you": a maxim that is ubiquitously on display throughout the novel.
