✂️: >-
  Kind Reader the hand that pened the most of this volum is now cold with the icy chill of death. The loveing heart from whence flowed the passages of affection in this volum is forever stilled, But the sperit that animated and prevad all I trust still lives, more pure, and refined than when on earth. A sperit perfect rejoicing around the throne of God and a Savior forever.
