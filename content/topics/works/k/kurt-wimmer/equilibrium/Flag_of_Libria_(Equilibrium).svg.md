This image is hosted on Wikipedia under fair use but may be copyrighted. I link to this image under fair use, in the context of supporting the film. I encourage you to support the people who made this film by restricting yourself to fair use -- better yet, purchase or rent the film. All major search engines will link to legal streaming services if you search with keywords such as "Watch Equilibrium". Example:

* https://duckduckgo.com/?q=watch+equilibrium+film
* https://bing.com/search?q=watch+equilibrium+film

The film can be rented for $3-$4 as of 2024. Personally I advise finding a hardcopy in DVD or BluRay format so you can hide an offline copy in preparation of a future dystopia.
