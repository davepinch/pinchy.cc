title: '"Arte Joven": 1901 a modernist magazine (revistas.um.es)'
excerpt: >-
  The magazine Arte Joven, published in 1901, was an exponent of the first modernist movement and its efforts to renew the arts and literature that developed in Spain at the turn of the 19th century to the 20th century. Writers and artists of different ways of thinking and with different aesthetic intentions participated in it, from Picasso to Unamuno, but with a common intention of overcoming the schemes established by the previous realist aesthetics.
