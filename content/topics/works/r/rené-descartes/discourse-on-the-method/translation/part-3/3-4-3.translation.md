translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 3, ¶ 4-3
ChatGPT: "These philosophers, constantly reflecting on the limits nature imposes on their power, became deeply convinced that the only thing truly within their control was their own thoughts. This belief alone was enough to keep them from desiring anything beyond their thoughts. They gained such complete control over their minds that they considered themselves richer, more powerful, freer, and happier than others. This was despite the advantages given to those who, without this philosophy, cannot fully realize all their desires, regardless of the gifts from nature and fortune."
