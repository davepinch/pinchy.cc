translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 3, ¶ 3-3
✂️: "This principle helped me avoid the regret and guilt that often trouble those with weak and uncertain minds. Such people, lacking a clear and firm principle for making decisions, might choose one course of action as the best today, only to abandon it tomorrow in favor of its opposite. By sticking to my principle, I avoided this kind of inconsistency and confusion."
