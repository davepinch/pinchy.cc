translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 3, ¶ 7-3
✂️: "I don’t know what caused this opinion. If my conversations played any part in it, it was likely because I freely admitted my ignorance more than those who have studied a little usually do. I probably explained the reasons for my doubts about many things others consider certain, rather than boasting about any philosophical system."
