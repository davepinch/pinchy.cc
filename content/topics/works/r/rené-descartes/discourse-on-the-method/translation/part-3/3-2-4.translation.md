translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 3, ¶ 2-4
✂️: "I considered promises that limit our freedom to be extreme. It's not that I disapproved of laws that help people with weak resolve stay committed to good causes through vows and contracts, or laws that secure commerce with similar commitments for neutral purposes. However, since nothing on earth is completely unchangeable, and I hoped to gradually improve my judgments, I thought it would be foolish to bind myself to something I approved of at one time, only to find it no longer good or valuable later. This would go against common sense, as it would prevent me from adapting my beliefs as circumstances changed or as my understanding improved."
