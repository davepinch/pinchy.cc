translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 3, ¶ 6-4
✂️: "I didn’t follow the example of the Skeptics, who doubt just for the sake of doubting and seek nothing beyond uncertainty. On the contrary, my goal was to find a solid foundation of certainty, clearing away the loose soil and sand to reach the firm rock or clay."
