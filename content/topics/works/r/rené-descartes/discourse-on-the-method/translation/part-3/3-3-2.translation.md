author: ChatGPT (GPT-40)
translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 3, ¶ 3-2
ChatGPT: "Similarly, because in many situations we need to act without delay, it’s clear that when we can’t determine what is true, we should act according to what seems most likely. Even if no opinion seems more probable than another, we should still pick one and treat it, in terms of action, as if it were undoubtedly true. The reasoning that led us to make that choice gives it the necessary certainty for practical purposes."
