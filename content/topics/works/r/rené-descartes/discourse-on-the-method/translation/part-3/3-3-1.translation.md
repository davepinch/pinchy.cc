translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 3, ¶ 3-1
✂️: "My second principle was to be as firm and determined in my actions as possible. Once I adopted an opinion, even if it was uncertain, I stuck to it as firmly as if it were highly certain. This is like what travelers should do if they get lost in a forest: instead of wandering aimlessly or staying in one place, they should pick a direction and move straight ahead without changing course for minor reasons. Even if the initial direction was chosen by chance, this approach increases their chances of reaching somewhere better than being stuck in the middle of the forest."
