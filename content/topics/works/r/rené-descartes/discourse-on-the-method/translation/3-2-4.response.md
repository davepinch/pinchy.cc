  What did Rene Descartes mean when he wrote, "And I placed in the class of extremes especially all promises by which somewhat of our freedom is abridged; not that I disapproved of the laws which, to provide against the instability of men of feeble resolution, when what is sought to be accomplished is some good, permit engagements by vows and contracts binding the parties to persevere in it, or even, for the security of commerce, sanction similar engagements where the purpose sought to be realized is indifferent: but because I did not find anything on earth which was wholly superior to change, and because, for myself in particular, I hoped gradually to perfect my judgments, and not to suffer them to deteriorate, I would have deemed it a grave sin against good sense, if, for the reason that I approved of something at a particular time, I therefore bound myself to hold it for good at a subsequent time, when perhaps it had ceased to be so, or I had ceased to esteem it such."

  In this passage from his "Discourse on the Method," René Descartes explains his views on commitments and promises, particularly those that limit personal freedom. He emphasizes a few key points:
  1. **Skepticism of Binding Promises**: Descartes places promises that limit freedom in the category of extremes. He is wary of making commitments that might restrict his ability to change his mind or adapt his views.
  2. **Approval of Certain Laws and Contracts**: He does not disapprove of laws or contracts that help people with weak resolve to accomplish good things or ensure stability in commerce. Such commitments can be beneficial for societal stability and economic security.
  3. **Change and Personal Growth**: Descartes acknowledges that nothing on earth is entirely free from change. For himself, he aspires to continually perfect his judgments. Binding oneself to a decision made at one time could be unreasonable if circumstances or perspectives change.
  4. **Flexibility in Judgments**: He believes it would be a serious mistake to feel obligated to maintain a belief or commitment just because he once approved of it. If something he once valued no longer seems good, or if his judgment of it changes, he does not want to be bound by past commitments.
  In essence, Descartes argues for maintaining intellectual and personal flexibility, allowing one's judgments and commitments to evolve with new experiences and information. This approach aligns with his broader philosophical method of doubt and continuous reassessment of beliefs.
