author: ChatGPT (GPD-40 mini)
translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 4, ¶ 4-2
ChatGPT: "Regarding thoughts about many external objects like the sky, the earth, light, heat, and countless others, I found it easier to understand where they came from. Since I didn't see anything in these thoughts that made them superior to myself, I could believe that if these objects were real, they were dependent on my own nature, given its certain perfection. And if they were false, it would be because I had them from nothing—meaning they existed in me due to an imperfection in my nature."
