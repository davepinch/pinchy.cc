translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 4, ¶ 1-3
ChatGPT: "I had previously observed that, in practical matters, it is sometimes necessary to accept highly uncertain opinions as if they were beyond doubt. However, since I wanted to focus solely on the search for truth, I believed the opposite approach was needed. I decided to reject as absolutely false any opinion that had even the slightest reason for doubt, to see if anything remained in my beliefs that was completely beyond doubt."
