ChatGPT: "Next, I realized that there was nothing in these geometric proofs that could guarantee the actual existence of their objects. For example, while I could clearly see that the angles of a given triangle must add up to two right angles, this didn't confirm that any actual triangle existed. On the other hand, when I examined the idea of a Perfect Being, I found that the existence of such a Being was as integral to its idea as the sum of the angles in a triangle is to its definition, or the equidistance of all points on a sphere's surface from its center. Therefore, it's at least as certain that God, as this Perfect Being, exists, as any geometric proof can be."
