translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 4, ¶ 4-5
ChatGPT: "To understand the nature of God (whose existence I had already established through my previous reasoning), I needed only to examine the properties I had an idea of and see if they were signs of perfection. I was confident that none of the properties indicating imperfection were in God, and that none of the other properties were missing."
