title: "Discourse on the Method, part 4, ¶ 8-2"
author: René Descartes
⬅️: "Discourse on the Method, part 4, ¶ 8-1"
➡️: "Discourse on the Method, part 4, ¶ 8-3"
✂️: "For if it happened that an individual, even when asleep, had some very distinct idea, as, for example, if a geometer should discover some new demonstration, the circumstance of his being asleep would not militate against its truth; and as for the most ordinary error of our dreams, which consists in their representing to us various objects in the same way as our external senses, this is not prejudicial, since it leads us very properly to suspect the truth of the ideas of sense; for we are not unfrequently deceived in the same manner when awake; as when persons in the jaundice see all objects yellow, or when the stars or bodies at a great distance appear to us much smaller than they are."
