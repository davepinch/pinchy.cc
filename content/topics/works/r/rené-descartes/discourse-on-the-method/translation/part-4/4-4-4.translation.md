translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 4, ¶ 4-4
ChatGPT: "I also added that, since I knew of perfections that I didn’t have, I couldn’t be the only being in existence (I’ll use traditional terms here, if you don’t mind). On the contrary, there must be a more perfect Being upon whom I depend and from whom I received everything I possess. If I had existed alone and independently, and if I had gotten all the perfection I have from myself, then, for the same reason, I should have been able to obtain all the remaining perfection I was aware of lacking. In that case, I could have become infinite, eternal, immutable, all-knowing, all-powerful, and possessed all the perfections I recognize in God."
