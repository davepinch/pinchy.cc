✂️: "And because our reasonings are never so clear or so complete during sleep as when we are awake, although sometimes the acts of our imagination are then as lively and distinct, if not more so than in our waking moments, Reason further dictates that, since all our thoughts cannot be true because of our partial imperfection, those. 'possessing truth must infallibly be found in the experience of our waking moments rather than in that of our dreams."
