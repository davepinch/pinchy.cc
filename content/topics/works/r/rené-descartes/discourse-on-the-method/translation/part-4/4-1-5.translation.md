translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 4, ¶ 1-5
ChatGPT: "But then I noticed that while I was thinking that everything was false, it was absolutely necessary that I, who was thinking this, must exist. I realized that the statement *I think, therefore I am* was so certain and clear that no doubt, no matter how extreme, could undermine it. I concluded that I could accept this as the first principle of the philosophy I was seeking."
