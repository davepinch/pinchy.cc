translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 4, ¶ 1-4
ChatGPT: "Since our senses sometimes deceive us, I decided to assume that nothing is really as they present it to us. And because people can make mistakes in reasoning, even in simple geometry, I, knowing that I am just as prone to error as anyone else, rejected as false all the reasonings I had previously considered as demonstrations. Finally, considering that the same thoughts we have while awake can also occur in dreams, where none of them are true, I supposed that all the ideas that had ever entered my mind while awake were no more true than the illusions of dreams."
