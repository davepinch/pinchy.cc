translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 4, ¶ 3-2
ChatGPT: "Since I saw that the only assurance of the truth in the statement *I think, therefore I am* comes from the clear understanding that thinking requires existence, I concluded that I could use the principle that whatever we clearly and distinctly conceive is true. However, I noted that there is some difficulty in accurately identifying what we distinctly conceive."
