author: ChatGPT (GPD-40 mini)
translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 4, ¶ 6-1
ChatGPT: "Many people find it hard to understand this truth, and even to grasp what their own mind truly is, because they rarely think beyond physical objects. They’re so used to thinking through imagination, which is limited to material things, that they believe anything that can’t be imagined isn’t understandable."
