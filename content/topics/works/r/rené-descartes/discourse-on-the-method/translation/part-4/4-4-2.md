title: "Discourse on the Method, part 4, ¶ 4-2"
author: René Descartes
➡️: "Discourse on the Method, part 4, ¶ 4-3"
✂️: "As for the thoughts of many other objects external to me, as of the sky, the earth, light, heat, and a thousand more, I was less at a loss to know whence these came; for since I remarked in them nothing which seemed to render them superior to myself, I could believe that, if these were true, they were dependencies on my own nature, in so far as it possessed a certain perfection, and, if they were false, that I held them from nothing, that is to say, that they were in me because of a certain imperfection of my nature."
