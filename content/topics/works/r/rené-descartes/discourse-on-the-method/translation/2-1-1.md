➡️: "Discourse on the Method, part 2, ¶ 1-2"
✂️: "I was then in Germany, attracted thither by the wars in that country, which have not yet been brought to a termination; and as I was returning to the army from the coronation of the Emperor, the setting in of winter arrested me in a locality where, as I found no society to interest me, and was besides fortunately undisturbed by any cares or passions, I remained the whole day in seclusion[^1], with full opportunity to occupy my attention with my own thoughts."
