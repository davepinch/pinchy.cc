translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 3, ¶ 4-2
✂️: "I admit that it takes a lot of practice and frequent reflection to train the mind to see things this way. I believe this was the key to the strength of ancient philosophers who managed to rise above the impact of fortune and, despite suffering and poverty, found a happiness that even their gods might have envied."
