  What did René Descartes mean when he wrote, "My third maxim was to endeavour always to conquer myself rather than fortune, and change my desires rather than the order of the world, and in general, accustom myself to the persuasion that, except our own thoughts, there is nothing absolutely in our power; so that when we have done our best in respect of things external to us, all wherein we fail of success is to be held, as regards us, absolutely impossible and this single principle seemed to me sufficient to prevent me from desiring for the future anything which I could not obtain, and thus render me contented; for since our will naturally seeks those objects alone which the understanding represents as in some way possible of attainment, it is plain, that if we consider all external goods as equally beyond our power, we shall no more regret the absence of such goods as seem due to our birth, when deprived of them without any fault of ours, than our not possessing the kingdoms of China or Mexico; and thus making, so to speak, a virtue of necessity, we shall no more desire health in disease, or freedom in imprisonment, than we now do bodies incorruptible as diamonds, or the wings of birds to fly with."

  René Descartes, in this passage, is articulating a philosophy of personal contentment and inner control. He proposes several key ideas:
  1. **Conquering Oneself Rather Than Fortune**: Descartes suggests that one should focus on controlling one's own reactions and desires instead of trying to control external circumstances, which are often beyond one's control. This implies a shift from trying to change the world to changing oneself.
  2. **Changing Desires**: By changing one's desires to align with what is possible and within reach, one can avoid the frustration and disappointment that comes from desiring the unattainable. This is about adjusting expectations and ambitions to match reality.
  3. **Power Over Thoughts**: Descartes emphasizes that our thoughts are the only things absolutely within our power. Since we can control our thoughts, we should focus on this control to find contentment.
  4. **Acceptance of External Limits**: Recognizing that some things are beyond our power allows us to accept failures or setbacks as unavoidable rather than personal shortcomings. This helps in maintaining peace of mind and reduces unnecessary desires for things that are impossible to achieve.
  5. **Virtue of Necessity**: By accepting the natural limits of our power and circumstances, we cultivate a sense of contentment. This is described as making a "virtue of necessity," meaning we should not desire what is inherently impossible (like health during illness or freedom during imprisonment) any more than we desire unrealistic things like being as incorruptible as diamonds or having wings.
  In essence, Descartes is advocating for a stoic-like approach to life, where inner peace and happiness are achieved through self-discipline, acceptance of reality, and control over one's own thoughts and desires.
