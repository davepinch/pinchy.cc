translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 4, ¶ 4-3
✂️: "However, this couldn’t apply to the idea of a nature more perfect than mine. It was clearly impossible to have this idea come from nothing. Since it’s just as unreasonable for a more perfect being to be an effect or dependent on a less perfect one as it is for something to come from nothing, it was equally impossible for me to have created this idea myself. Therefore, the only remaining possibility was that this idea was placed in me by a nature that was actually more perfect than mine, which had within itself all the perfections I could imagine. In other words, this nature was God."
