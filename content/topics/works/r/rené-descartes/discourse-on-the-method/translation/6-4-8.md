➡️: Discourse on the Method, part 6, ¶ 4-9
✂️: "As for myself, if I have succeeded in discovering any truths in the Sciences, (and I trust that what is contained in this volume[^1] will show that I have found some,) I can declare that they are but the consequences and results of five or six principal difficulties which I have surmounted, and my encounters with which I reckoned as battles in which victory declared for me."
