translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 3, ¶ 7-4
✂️: "Since I dislike being seen as different from who I truly am, I felt it necessary to make myself worthy of the reputation given to me. For the past eight years, this desire has driven me to move away from places where my acquaintances might interrupt me. I came to this country, where the long-lasting war has created such discipline that the armies only seem to serve the purpose of allowing the inhabitants to enjoy peace more securely. Here, among a bustling crowd focused on their own business and not overly interested in others' affairs, I have been able to live with all the conveniences of the most populous cities, yet as solitary and secluded as if I were in the most remote deserts."
