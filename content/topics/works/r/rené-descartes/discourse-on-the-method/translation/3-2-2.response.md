  What did René Descartes mean when he said "For, as I had from that time begun to hold my own opinions for nought because I wished to subject them all to examination, I was convinced that I could not do better than follow in the meantime the opinions of the most judicious; and although there are some perhaps among the Persians and Chinese as judicious as among ourselves, expediency seemed to dictate that I should regulate my practice conformably to the opinions of those with whom I should have to live; and it appeared to me that, in order to ascertain the real opinions of such, I ought rather to take cognizance of what they practised than of what they said, not only because, in the corruption of our manners, there are few disposed to speak exactly as they believe, but also because very many are not aware of what it is that they really believe; for, as the act of mind by which a thing is believed is different from that by which we know that we believe it, the one act is often found without the other."

  René Descartes is expressing the idea that, in his quest for knowledge and truth, he decided to temporarily set aside his own opinions and instead follow the beliefs of the most prudent and judicious individuals around him. He recognizes that while wise individuals may exist in different cultures, practical considerations led him to align his behavior with the opinions of those he lived among.
  He emphasizes that understanding people’s true beliefs is better achieved by observing their actions rather than listening to their words. This is because people often do not express their true thoughts due to societal corruption or simply because they are not fully conscious of their own beliefs. Descartes notes that the mental process of holding a belief is different from the process of being aware of that belief, which means people can believe something without realizing it. This distinction leads him to conclude that actions are a more reliable indicator of true beliefs than words.
