translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 4, ¶ 4-1
✂️: "Next, reflecting on the fact that I doubted, and that therefore my existence was not entirely perfect (since I clearly saw that knowing is a greater perfection than doubting), I began to question where I had learned to think of something more perfect than myself. I realized that I must have gotten this idea from a nature that is actually more perfect."
