  In this statement, René Descartes emphasizes the importance of a systematic approach to problem-solving, which he believes provides certainty similar to that found in arithmetic. Breaking it down:
  **"Adherence to the true order"**: Descartes is advocating for a methodical and orderly approach to thinking and problem-solving. This means following a logical sequence of steps rather than approaching problems haphazardly.
  **"An exact enumeration of all the conditions of the thing sought"**: This phrase highlights the necessity of thoroughly identifying and considering all relevant factors and conditions related to the problem at hand. Nothing should be overlooked or taken for granted.
  **"Includes all that gives certitude to the rules of Arithmetic": Descartes draws a parallel between his method and arithmetic, suggesting that just as arithmetic rules are precise and reliable, his method, when followed correctly, will lead to certain and reliable conclusions.
  In essence, Descartes is saying that by following a structured and comprehensive method, akin to the rigorous rules of arithmetic, one can achieve certainty and clarity in understanding and solving problems.
