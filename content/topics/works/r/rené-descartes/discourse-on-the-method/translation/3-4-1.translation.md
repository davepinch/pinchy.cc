translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 3, ¶ 4-1
✂️: "My third principle was to focus on mastering myself rather than trying to control external circumstances. I aimed to change my desires rather than trying to change the world around me. I accepted that, aside from our own thoughts, nothing is truly within our control. Therefore, once I had done my best with things outside of myself, I considered anything I failed to achieve as absolutely impossible for me. This principle helped me avoid desiring things I couldn’t obtain, making me more content. Since our will naturally seeks only what we think is attainable, if we view all external goods as beyond our reach, we won’t regret lacking things we’re born without any more than we would regret not having the kingdoms of China or Mexico. By accepting this, we learn to be content with our circumstances, just as we don’t desire things like incorruptible bodies or the ability to fly when we’re sick or imprisoned."
