➡️: "Discourse on the Method, part 1, ¶ 14-3"
author: René Descartes
✂️: "I spent the remainder of my youth in travelling, in visiting courts and armies, in holding intercourse with men of different dispositions and ranks, in collecting varied experience, in proving myself in the different situations into which fortune threw me, and, above all, in making such reflection on the matter of my experience as to secure my improvement."
