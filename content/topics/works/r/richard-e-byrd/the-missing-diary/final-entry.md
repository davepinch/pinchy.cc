title: "December 30, 1956 - FINAL ENTRY (WARNING: FRAUDULENT)"
entry: >-
   These last few years elapsed since 1947 have not been kind... I now make my final entry in this singular diary. In closing, I must state that I have faithfully kept this matter secret as directed all these years. It has been completely against my values of moral right. Now, I seem to sense the long night coming on and this secret will not die with me, but as all truth shall, it will triumph and so it shall. This can be the only hope for mankind. I have seen the truth and it has quickened my spirit and has set me free! I have done my duty toward the monstrous military industrial complex. Now, the long night begins to approach, but there shall be no end. Just as the long night of the Arctic ends, the brilliant sunshine of Truth shall come again... and those who are of darkness shall fall in its Light... FOR I HAVE SEEN THAT LAND BEYOND THE POLE, THAT CENTER OF THE GREAT UNKNOWN

warning: >-
  This alleged 1956 diary entry uses the term "military industrial complex", which was coined by Eisenhower in 1961. There is no known use of the term prior to 1961, although there are some cases where authors discussed the concept using different words. Therefore this diary entry and the book is FAKE.
