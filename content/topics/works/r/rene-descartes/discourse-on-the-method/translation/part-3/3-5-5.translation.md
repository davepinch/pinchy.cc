translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 3, ¶ 5-5
ChatGPT: "Since God has given each of us some innate ability to discern truth from falsehood, I couldn’t believe it was right to rely solely on others' opinions. I felt I should use my own judgment to examine and understand these opinions, but only when I was truly prepared for the task."
