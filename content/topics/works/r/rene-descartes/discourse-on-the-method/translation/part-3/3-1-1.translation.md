ChatGPT: "Just like when you need to rebuild a house, you first have to tear it down and gather new materials and builders. But you also need a temporary place to stay while the new house is being built. In the same way, I realized I needed a temporary set of morals to live by while I rethought my beliefs. I didn't want to be stuck in indecision, so I created a provisional code of morals with a few key principles to guide my actions and ensure I could live happily while working on my new foundation of beliefs. Now, let me share these principles with you."
