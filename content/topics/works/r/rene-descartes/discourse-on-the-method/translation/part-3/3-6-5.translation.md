translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 3, ¶ 6-5
ChatGPT: "In this effort, I believe I was quite successful. Since I aimed to uncover the falsehood or uncertainty of the propositions I examined using clear and definite reasoning, I found that nothing was so doubtful that it didn’t lead to some conclusion with sufficient certainty, even if that conclusion was simply that the matter had no certainty at all."
