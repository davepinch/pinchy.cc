translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 3, ¶ 6-3
ChatGPT: "Over the next nine years, I spent my time traveling from place to place, wanting to observe rather than actively participate in the events of the world. As I focused on carefully examining what could be doubted or might lead to mistakes, I gradually eliminated all the errors that had previously taken root in my mind."
