translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 3, ¶ 2-3
ChatGPT: "Among many equally respected opinions, I always chose the most moderate ones. This was because moderate opinions are usually the easiest to follow in practice and are likely the best, since extremes are generally bad. Also, if I happened to be wrong, being closer to the middle meant I would be less far from the truth than if I had chosen an extreme view and needed to switch to the opposite extreme."
