author: ChatGPT (GPT-40)
translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 3, ¶ 2-2
ChatGPT: "Since I had decided to question all my previous beliefs and opinions, I thought it was best to temporarily follow the views of the wisest people around me. Even though there might be equally wise individuals among the Persians or Chinese, it made sense to follow the opinions of those I lived among. To understand their true beliefs, I realized I should pay more attention to their actions rather than their words. This is because, in our corrupt society, people often don't speak exactly what they believe, and many are unaware of their true beliefs. The mental act of believing something is different from knowing that you believe it, so sometimes people believe things without being conscious of it."
