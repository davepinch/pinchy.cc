translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 3, ¶ 6-8
ChatGPT: "So, although I seemed to live like those who, with no other aim than to spend their lives pleasantly and innocently, focus on separating pleasure from vice and engage in honorable activities to avoid boredom, I was actually pursuing my goal. I made greater progress in understanding the truth than I might have if I had only read books or interacted with scholars."
