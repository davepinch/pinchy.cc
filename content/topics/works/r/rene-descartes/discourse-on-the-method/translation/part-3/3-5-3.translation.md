translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 3, ¶ 5-3
ChatGPT: "Since I began using this method, it has brought me such deep satisfaction that I couldn’t imagine a greater or purer joy in life. As I uncovered important truths that others generally did not know, the pleasure I derived from this discovery filled my mind so completely that I became entirely indifferent to everything else."
