translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 4, ¶ 5-1
ChatGPT: "I was ready to look for other truths. I imagined the object of geometry, which I thought of as a continuous body or space that extends indefinitely in length, width, and depth, which can be divided into parts with different shapes and sizes, and can be moved or rearranged in various ways. (This is what geometers assume is in the object they study.) I reviewed some of their simplest proofs."
