author: ChatGPT (GPD-40 mini)
translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 4, ¶ 4-8
ChatGPT: "Since I had clearly recognized that the nature of the mind is distinct from that of the body, and because I saw that any kind of composition indicates dependency, which is a form of imperfection, I concluded that it could not be a perfection in God to be composed of both these natures. Therefore, I determined that God is not composed of these two natures. Instead, if there are any bodies, intelligences, or other beings in the world that are not perfectly complete, their existence depends on God’s power so that they could not exist for even a single moment without Him."
