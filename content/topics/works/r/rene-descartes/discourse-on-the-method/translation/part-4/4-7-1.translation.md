translation (ChatGPT) of: Discourse on the Method, part 4, ¶ 7-1
ChatGPT: "Finally, if there are still people who are not sufficiently convinced of the existence of God and the soul by the reasons I have given, I want them to understand that all the other propositions they consider themselves more certain of—such as having a body, the existence of stars, and the earth—are actually less certain. Even though we have a strong moral assurance of these things, and it might seem absurd to doubt their existence, no one in their right mind can deny, when it comes to metaphysical certainty, that there is enough reason to doubt. This is evident when we consider that, while asleep, we can imagine ourselves having a different body, seeing other stars, and another earth, even though none of these things are real."
