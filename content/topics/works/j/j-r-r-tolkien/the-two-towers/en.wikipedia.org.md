excerpt: >-
  ***The Two Towers*** is the second volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's high fantasy novel *The Lord of the Rings*. It is preceded by *The Fellowship of the Ring* and followed by *The Return of the King*. The volume's title is ambiguous, as five towers are named in the narrative, and Tolkien himself gave conflicting identifications of the two towers. The narrative is interlaced, allowing Tolkien to build in suspense and surprise. The volume was largely welcomed by critics, who found it exciting and compelling, combining epic narrative with heroic romance.
