excerpt: >-
  ***The Scarlet Plague*** is a post-apocalyptic fiction novel by American writer Jack London, originally published in The London Magazine in 1912. The book was noted in 2020 as having been very similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially given London wrote it at a time when the world was not as quickly connected by travel as it is today.
