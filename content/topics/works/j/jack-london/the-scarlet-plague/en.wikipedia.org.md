excerpt: >-
  The **Scarlet Plague** is a post-apocalyptic fiction novel by American writer Jack London, originally published in The London Magazine in 1912. The book was noted in 2020 as having been very similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially given London wrote it at a time when the world was not as quickly connected by travel as it is today. However unlike COVID-19, in this story, victims died within an hour and mortality was practically 100%.
