title: "The Scarlet Plague by Jack London (gutenberg.org)"
ebook of: The Scarlet Plague
excerpt: >-
  The way led along upon what had once been the embankment of a railroad. But no train had run upon it for many years. The forest on either side swelled up the slopes of the embankment and crested across it in a green wave of trees and bushes. The trail was as narrow as a manâ€™s body, and was no more than a wild-animal runway.
