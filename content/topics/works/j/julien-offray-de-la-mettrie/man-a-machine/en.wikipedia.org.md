excerpt: >-
  ***Man a Machine*** (French: L'homme machine) is a work of [materialist](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism/) philosophy by the 18th-century French physician and philosopher [Julien Offray de La Mettrie](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien_Offray_de_La_Mettrie/), first published in 1747. In this work, de La Mettrie extends [Descartes](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/René_Descartes/)' argument that animals are mere automatons, or machines, to human beings. He denies dualism and the existence of the soul as a substance separate from matter.
