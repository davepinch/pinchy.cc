excerpt: >-
  ***The Social Contract***, originally published as ***On the Social Contract; or, Principles of Political Right*** (French: *Du contrat social; ou, Principes du droit politique*), is a 1762 French-language book by the Genevan philosopher [Jean-Jacques Rousseau](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau/). The book theorizes about how to establish legitimate authority in a political community, that is, one compatible with individual freedom, in the face of the problems of commercial society, which Rousseau had already identified in his *Discourse on Inequality* (1755).
