  The ***Zhuangzi*** (Chinese: 莊子, historically romanized ***Chuang Tzŭ***) is an ancient Chinese text from the late Warring States period (476–221 BC) containing stories and anecdotes that exemplify the carefree nature of the ideal Taoist sage. Named for its traditional author, "Master Zhuang" (Zhuangzi), the *Zhuangzi* is one of the two foundational texts of Taoism, along with the *Tao Te Ching*.
