excerpt: >-
  "Life on the Mississippi" by Mark Twain is a memoir and historical account written during the late 19th century. The narrative focuses on the author's experiences as a young riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River, providing insights into the river's history, geography, and the profession of piloting, intertwined with Twain's characteristic wit and humor. The opening of the memoir begins with Twain discussing the remarkable features of the Mississippi River, highlighting its unusual shape, immense drainage basin, and significant historical importance. He reflects on the river's physical properties, such as its ability to shift locations and the vast amount of sediment it carries to the Gulf of Mexico. Twain introduces historical figures like De Soto and La Salle, tracing the exploration and subsequent navigation of this great waterway. Through vivid descriptions and engaging anecdotes, the beginning sets the stage for a deeper exploration of life on the river, the challenges faced by pilots, and the culture surrounding steamboat travel in Twain's time.
