excerpt: >-
  Magdalena Abakanowicz's figures are instantly identifiable by their stark imagery. The haunting power of these headless, standing figures invites many interpretations, and the artist welcomes this approach. Could they be awaiting final judgment? Do they suggest war victims? Are they primordial beings in silent communication? Each figure is individually cast from a burlap-lined body mold.
