  ***Everywhere at the End of Time*** is the eleventh and final recording by [the Caretaker](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Caretaker_(musician)/), an alias of English electronic musician Leyland Kirby. Released between 2016 and 2019, its six studio albums use degrading loops of sampled ballroom music to portray the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Inspired by the success of *An Empty Bliss Beyond This World* (2011), Kirby produced Everywhere as his final major work under the alias. The albums were produced in Krak√≥w and released over six-month periods to "give a sense of time passing", with abstract album covers by his friend Ivan Seal. The series drew comparisons to the works of composer William Basinski and electronic musician Burial, while the later stages were influenced by avant-gardist composer [John Cage](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage/).
