excerpt: >-
  **The Lincoln Project** is a centrist American political action committee (PAC) founded in December 2019 by moderate conservatives and former Republican Party members who oppose Trumpism and 45th U.S. president Donald Trump. During the 2020 presidential election, it aimed to prevent the re-election of president Donald Trump, and to defeat incumbent Republican candidates running for re-election who had been loyalists to Trump. In April 2020, the committee endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. As of 2023, the committee is focused on preventing a non-consecutive re-election of Trump in the 2024 presidential election.
