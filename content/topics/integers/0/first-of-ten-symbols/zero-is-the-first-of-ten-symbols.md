title: "Zero  is  the  first  of  ten  symbols — the digits — with  which  we  are  able  to  represent any  of  an  infinitude  of  numbers.  Zero  is  also the  first  of  the  numbers  which  we  must represent.  Yet  zero,  first  of  the  digits,  was the  last  to  be  invented;  and  zero,  first  of  the numbers,  was  the  last  to  be  discovered."
