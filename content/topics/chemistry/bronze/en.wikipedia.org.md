> **Bronze** is an alloy consisting primarily of copper, commonly with about 12â€“12.5% [tin](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin) and often with the addition of other metals (including aluminium, manganese, nickel, or zinc) and sometimes non-metals, such as phosphorus, or metalloids such as [arsenic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic) or silicon. These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone, or have other useful properties, such as strength, ductility, or machinability.
