Chlorine is a yellow-green gas at room temperature. It is an extremely reactive element and a strong oxidising agent: among the elements, it has the highest electron affinity and the third-highest electronegativity on the revised Pauling scale, behind only [oxygen](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen/) and fluorine.
