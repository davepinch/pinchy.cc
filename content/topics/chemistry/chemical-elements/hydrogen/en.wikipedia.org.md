  **Hydrogen** is a [chemical element](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element/); it has symbol **H** and atomic number 1. It is the lightest element and, at standard conditions, is a gas of diatomic molecules with the formula H2. It is colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Hydrogen is the most abundant chemical substance in the [universe](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe/), constituting roughly 75% of all normal matter. Stars such as the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun/) are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. Most of the hydrogen on [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/) exists in molecular forms such as water and organic compounds. For the most common isotope of hydrogen (symbol 1H) each atom has one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.
