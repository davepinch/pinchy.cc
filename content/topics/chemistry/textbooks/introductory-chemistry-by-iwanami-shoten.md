title: Introductory Chemistry by Iwanami Shoten
excerpt: >-
  A group of Japanese chemists launched a project to disseminate a series of “Introduction to Chemistry” by the Internet. As the representative of the group, the author wishes to introduce the purpose of this project, and the structure of the series, to the potential users of the textbooks. For this purpose, the author prepared two short articles, one is the Q&A on the project, and the other Preface to the series. We wish the series would be used by many young students and citizens who have some difficulty in purchasing textbooks though they are very much interested in chemistry
