  The **halogens** (/ˈhælədʒən, ˈheɪ-, -loʊ-, -ˌdʒɛn/) are a group in the periodic table consisting of six chemically related elements: [fluorine](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine/) (F), [chlorine](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine/) (Cl), [bromine](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromine/) (Br), [iodine](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine/) (I), and the radioactive elements [astatine](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astatine/) (At) and [tennessine](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessine/) (Ts), though some authors would exclude tennessine as its chemistry is unknown and is theoretically expected to be more like that of gallium. In the modern IUPAC nomenclature, this group is known as group 17.
