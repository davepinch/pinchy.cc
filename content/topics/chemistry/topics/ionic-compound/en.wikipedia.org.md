excerpt: >-
  In chemistry, an **ionic compound** is a [chemical compound](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound/) composed of ions held together by electrostatic forces termed ionic bonding. The compound is neutral overall, but consists of positively charged ions called cations and negatively charged ions called anions. These can be simple ions such as the [sodium](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium/) (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) in sodium chloride, or polyatomic species such as the ammonium and carbonate ions in ammonium carbonate. Individual ions within an ionic compound usually have multiple nearest neighbours, so are not considered to be part of molecules, but instead part of a continuous three-dimensional network. Ionic compounds usually form crystalline structures when solid.
