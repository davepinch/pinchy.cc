excerpt: >-
  **Iodine** is a [chemical element](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element/) with the symbol **I** and atomic number 53. The heaviest of the stable [halogens](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halogen/), it exists at standard conditions as a semi-lustrous, non-metallic solid that melts to form a deep violet liquid at 114 °C (237 °F), and boils to a violet gas at 184 °C (363 °F). The element was discovered by the French chemist Bernard Courtois in 1811 and was named two years later by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, after the Ancient Greek Ιώδης 'violet-coloured'.
