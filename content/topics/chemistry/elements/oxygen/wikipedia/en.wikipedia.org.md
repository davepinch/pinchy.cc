excerpt: >-
  **Oxygen** is a [chemical element](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element/); it has symbol **O** and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table, a highly reactive nonmetal, and an oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds. Oxygen is [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/)'s most abundant element, and after [hydrogen](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen/) and helium, it is the third-most abundant element in the [universe](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe/). At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O2. Diatomic oxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% of the Earth's atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth's crust in the form of oxides.
