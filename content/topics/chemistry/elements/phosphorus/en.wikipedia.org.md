excerpt: >-
  **Phosphorus** is a chemical element; it has symbol **P** and atomic number 15. Elemental phosphorus exists in two major forms, white phosphorus and red phosphorus, but because it is highly reactive, phosphorus is never found as a free element on [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth/). It has a concentration in the Earth's crust of about one gram per kilogram (compare copper at about 0.06 grams). In minerals, phosphorus generally occurs as phosphate.
