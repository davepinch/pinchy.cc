excerpt: >-
  **Tin** is a [chemical element](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element/) with the symbol **Sn** (from Latin stannum) and atomic number 50. A silvery-coloured metal, tin is soft enough to be cut with little force, and a bar of tin can be bent by hand with little effort. When bent, the so-called "tin cry" can be heard as a result of twinning in tin crystals; this trait is shared by indium, cadmium, zinc, and mercury in its solid state.
