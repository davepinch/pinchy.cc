title: "My Gold Prospecting and Mining Pages (mdpub.com)"
author: Michael Davis
excerpt: >-
  One of my many hobbies is recreational gold prospecting and mining. I've been gold panning, metal detecting and sluicing on my vacations for many years. It's a lot of fun. It's great exercise. I get to do it in really scenic locations, outside in the fresh air and sunshine. I have even found some gold. This page links to accounts of my various adventures in pursuit of the shiny yellow stuff. More will be added in the future.
