**Alpha** /ˈælfə/ (uppercase **Α**, lowercase **α**; Ancient Greek: ἄλφα, *álpha*, or Greek: άλφα, romanized: álfa) is the first letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of one. Alpha is derived from the Phoenician letter aleph aleph, which is the West Semitic word for "ox". Letters that arose from alpha include the Latin letter A and the Cyrillic letter А.
