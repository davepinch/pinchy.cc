description: >-
  Illustration of hypothetical damage pattern on a WW2 bomber. Loosely based on data from an unillustrated report by Abraham Wald (1943), showing that a similar plane survived a single hit to the engine 60% of the time, but a hit to the fuselage or fuel system closer to 95% of the time. Picture is based on US Air Force "hit plots", such as this F-4 hit plot published in 1991. New version by McGeddon based on a Lockheed PV-1 Ventura drawing (2016), vector file by Martin Grandjean (2021).
