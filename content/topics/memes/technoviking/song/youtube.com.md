title: "TechnoViking 100% OFFICIAL Song (youtube.com)"
excerpt: >-
  FINALLY! The official version of the song that is played on the TechnoViking video. Some said it was Panderator...Some said it was Can-D-Music. WELL! I played around with the songs a bit, and made quite possibly the biggest human discovery since steamed toast. It is actually Navigator by Can-D-Music, but the DJs in the original TechnoViking video had it sped up either on purpose, or on accident. This uses a 96.5:100 compression ratio. Speed up to 1:30 and you'll recognize the song instantly. Enjoy all of you TV fans!
