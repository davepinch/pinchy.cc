excerpt: >-
  **Tetraodontidae** is a family of primarily marine and estuarine fish of the order Tetraodontiformes. The family includes many familiar species variously called **pufferfish**, **puffers**, **balloonfish**, **blowfish**, **blowies**, **bubblefish**, **globefish**, **swellfish**, **toadfish**, **toadies**, **toadle**, **honey toads**, **Haaris Anwar fish**, **sugar toads**, and **sea squab**. They are morphologically similar to the closely related porcupinefish, which have large external spines (unlike the thinner, hidden spines of the Tetraodontidae, which are only visible when the fish have puffed up). The scientific name refers to the four large teeth, fused into an upper and lower plate, which are used for crushing the hard shells of crustaceans and mollusks, their natural prey.
