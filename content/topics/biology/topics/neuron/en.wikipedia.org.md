excerpt: >-
  Within a [nervous system](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system/), a neuron, neurone, or nerve cell is an electrically excitable cell that fires electric signals called action potentials across a neural network. Neurons communicate with other cells via [synapses](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse/), which are specialized connections that commonly use minute amounts of chemical neurotransmitters to pass the electric signal from the presynaptic neuron to the target cell through the synaptic gap.
