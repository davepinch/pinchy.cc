In [biology](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology), a substrate is the surface on which an organism (such as a [plant](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant), [fungus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus), or [animal](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal)) lives. A substrate can include biotic or abiotic materials and animals. For example, encrusting algae that lives on a rock (its substrate) can be itself a substrate for an animal that lives on top of the algae. Inert substrates are used as growing support materials in the hydroponic cultivation of plants. In biology substrates are often activated by the nanoscopic process of substrate presentation.
