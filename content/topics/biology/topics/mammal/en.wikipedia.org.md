excerpt: >-
  A **mammal** (from Latin mamma 'breast') is a [vertebrate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate) [animal](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal) of the class Mammalia (/məˈmeɪli.ə/). Mammals are characterized by the presence of milk-producing mammary glands for feeding their young, a neocortex region of the brain, fur or hair, and three middle ear bones. These characteristics distinguish them from [reptiles](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile) and [birds](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird), from which their ancestors diverged in the Carboniferous Period over 300 million years ago. Around 6,400 extant species of mammals have been described and divided into 29 orders.
