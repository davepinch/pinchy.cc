excerpt: >-
  An **agaric** (/ˈæɡərɪk, əˈɡærɪk/) is a type of fungus fruiting body characterized by the presence of a pileus (cap) that is clearly differentiated from the stipe (stalk), with lamellae (gills) on the underside of the pileus. In the UK, agarics are called "mushrooms" or "toadstools". In [North America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America) they are typically called "gilled mushrooms". "Agaric" can also refer to a basidiomycete species characterized by an agaric-type fruiting body.
