excerpt: >-
  **Ants** are eusocial [insects](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect/) of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from vespoid wasp ancestors in the [Cretaceous](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous/) period. More than 13,800 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their geniculate (elbowed) antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.
