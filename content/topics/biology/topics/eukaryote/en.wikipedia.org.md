excerpt: >-
  The **eukaryotes** (/juːˈkærioʊts, -əts/) constitute the domain of **Eukarya**, organisms whose cells have a nucleus. All [animals](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal), [plants](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant), [fungi](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus), and many unicellular organisms are eukaryotes. They constitute a major group of life forms alongside the two groups of prokaryotes: the Bacteria and the Archaea. Eukaryotes represent a small minority of the number of organisms, but due to their generally much larger size, their collective global biomass is much larger than that of prokaryotes.
