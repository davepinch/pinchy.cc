excerpt: >-
  **Crabs** are decapod [crustaceans](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean/) of the infraorder **Brachyura**, which typically have a very short projecting "tail" (abdomen), usually hidden entirely under the thorax (brachyura means "short tail" in Greek). They live in all the world's oceans, in freshwater, and on land, are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton, and have a single pair of pincers. They first appeared during the [Jurassic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic/) Period.
