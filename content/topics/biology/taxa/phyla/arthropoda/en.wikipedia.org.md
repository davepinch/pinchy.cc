excerpt: >-
  **Arthropods** (/ˈɑːrθrəpɒd/ ARTH-rə-pod) are invertebrates in the phylum **Arthropoda**. They possess an exoskeleton with a cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate, a body with differentiated (metameric) segments, and paired jointed appendages. In order to keep growing, they must go through stages of moulting, a process by which they shed their exoskeleton to reveal a new one. They form an extremely diverse group of up to ten million species.
