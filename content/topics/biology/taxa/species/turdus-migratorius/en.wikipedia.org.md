excerpt: >-
  The **American robin** (**Turdus migratorius**) is a migratory bird of the true thrush genus and Turdidae, the wider thrush family. It is named after the European robin because of its reddish-orange breast, though the two species are not closely related, with the European robin belonging to the Old World flycatcher family. The American robin is widely distributed throughout [North America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America/), wintering from southern [Canada](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada/) to central [Mexico](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico/) and along the Pacific coast.
