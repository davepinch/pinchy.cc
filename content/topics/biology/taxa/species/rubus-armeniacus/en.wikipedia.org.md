excerpt: >-
  ***Rubus armeniacus***, the **Himalayan blackberry** or **Armenian blackberry**, is a species of *Rubus* in the blackberry group *Rubus* subgenus *Rubus* series *Discolores* (P.J. MÃ¼ll.) Focke. It is native to Armenia and Northern [Iran](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran/), and widely naturalised elsewhere. Both its scientific name and origin have been the subject of much confusion, with much of the literature referring to it as either *Rubus procerus* or *Rubus discolor*, and often mistakenly citing its origin as western European. *Flora of North America*, published in 2014, considers the taxonomy unsettled, and tentatively uses the older name *Rubus bifrons*.
