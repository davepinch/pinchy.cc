  ***Styrax japonicus*** (野茉莉, also エゴノキ, egonoki), also known as the **Japanese snowbell**, is a species of flowering plant in the family Styracaceae, native to Korea, Japan, and Southern China. Growing to 12 m (39 ft) tall by 8 m (26 ft) broad, it is a graceful, spreading deciduous tree with oval, upward-facing leaves which occasionally turn yellow or orange before falling in [autumn](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn). Masses of slightly fragrant, bell-shaped white flowers hang from the branches in summer, followed by fruits (drupes) which resemble olives in both shape and colour.
