excerpt: >-
  ***Thuja plicata*** is a large evergreen coniferous tree in the family Cupressaceae, native to the [Pacific Northwest](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest) of [North America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America). Its common name is **western redcedar** in the U.S. or **western red cedar** in the UK, and it is also called **pacific red cedar**, **giant arborvitae**, **western arborvitae**, just **cedar**, **giant cedar**, or **shinglewood**. It is not a true cedar of the genus *Cedrus*. *T. plicata* is the largest species in the genus *Thuja*, growing up to 70 metres (230 ft) tall and 7 metres (23 ft) in diameter. It mostly grows in areas that experience a mild climate with plentiful rainfall, although it is sometimes present in drier areas on sites where water is available year-round, such as wet valley bottoms and mountain streamsides. The species is shade-tolerant and able to establish in forest understories and is thus considered a climax species. It is a very long-lived tree, with some specimens reaching ages of well over 1,000 years.
