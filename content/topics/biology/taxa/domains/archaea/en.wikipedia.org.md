excerpt: >-
  **Archaea** (/ɑːrˈkiːə/ *ar-KEE-ə*; sg.: **archaeon** /ɑːrˈkiːən/ ar-KEE-ən) is a [domain](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(biology)/) of single-celled organisms. These microorganisms lack cell nuclei and are therefore prokaryotic. Archaea were initially classified as [bacteria](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria/), receiving the name archaebacteria (in the Archaebacteria kingdom), but this term has fallen out of use.
