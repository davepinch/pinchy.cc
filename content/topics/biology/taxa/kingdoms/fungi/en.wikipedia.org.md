  A **fungus** (pl: **fungi** or **funguses**) is any member of the group of [eukaryotic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote/) organisms that includes microorganisms such as yeasts and molds, as well as the more familiar mushrooms. These organisms are classified as a [kingdom](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_(biology)/), separately from the other eukaryotic kingdoms, which by one traditional classification include Plantae, [Animalia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal/), Protozoa, and Chromista.
