excerpt: >-
  Pacific ninebark is a long-lived perennial shrub of the Rose family native to the Pacific Northwest. It grows rapidly with multiple stems achieving 2 to 4 meters in an erect to arching form with angled branches. The reddish papery bark peels off in long thin layers giving rise to the common name. Deciduous leaves that appear alternately along the stem are 3-10 cm long, 3-5 lobed and doubly toothed at the margin. They are deeply veined, shiny dark green above and lighter beneath with fine star-shaped hairs
