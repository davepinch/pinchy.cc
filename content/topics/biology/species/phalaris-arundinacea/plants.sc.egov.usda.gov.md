title: "Phalaris arundinacea L. (plants.sc.egov.usda.gov)"
excerpt: >-
  Reed canarygrass is 2-9 feet tall non-native with flat, rough-textured, tapering leaves from 31/2-10 inches long. The stem is hairless and stands erect. One of the first grasses to sprout in the spring, reed canary grass produces a compact panicle 3-16 inches long that is erect or slightly spreading. The flowers are green to purple early in the season and change to beige over time. The grass forms a thick rhizome system that quickly dominates the soil. There is some debate as to the origin of the species. Sources document native and non-native genotypes of reed canary grass. The non-native strain is thought to be more invasive than native strain.
