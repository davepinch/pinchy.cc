  In biological taxonomy, a **domain** (/dəˈmeɪn/ or /doʊˈmeɪn/) (Latin: regio), also **dominion**, **superkingdom**, **realm**, or **empire**, is the highest taxonomic rank of all organisms taken together. It was introduced in the three-domain system of taxonomy devised by Carl Woese, Otto Kandler and Mark Wheelis in 1990.
