excerpt: >-
  In [biology](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology), a **species** is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which any two individuals of the appropriate sexes or mating types can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. It is the basic unit of classification and a [taxonomic rank](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank/) of an organism, as well as a unit of biodiversity. Other ways of defining species include their karyotype, DNA sequence, morphology, behaviour, or ecological niche. In addition, paleontologists use the concept of the chronospecies since fossil reproduction cannot be examined.
