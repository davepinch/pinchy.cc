excerpt: >-
  In biology, a **phylum** (/ˈfaɪləm/; pl.: phyla) is a level of classification or [taxonomic rank](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank/) below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division has been used instead of phylum, although the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepts the terms as equivalent. Depending on definitions, the animal kingdom Animalia contains about 31 phyla, the plant kingdom Plantae contains about 14 phyla, and the fungus kingdom Fungi contains about 8 phyla. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships among phyla within larger clades like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta.
