title: "Taxonomic rank (Wikipedia)"
excerpt: >-
  In biology, **taxonomic rank** is the relative level of a group of organisms (a taxon) in an ancestral or hereditary hierarchy. A common system of biological classification (taxonomy) consists of species, genus, family, order, class, [phylum](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylum/), kingdom, and domain. While older approaches to taxonomic classification were phenomenological, forming groups on the basis of similarities in appearance, organic structure and behaviour, methods based on genetic analysis have opened the road to cladistics.
