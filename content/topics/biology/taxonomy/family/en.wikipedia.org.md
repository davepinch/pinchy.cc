excerpt: >-
  **Family** (Latin: familia, pl.: familiae) is one of the nine major hierarchical [taxonomic ranks](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank/) in Linnaean taxonomy. It is classified between order and genus. A family may be divided into subfamilies, which are intermediate ranks between the ranks of family and genus. The official family names are Latin in origin; however, popular names are often used: for example, walnut trees and hickory trees belong to the family Juglandaceae, but that family is commonly referred to as the "walnut family".
