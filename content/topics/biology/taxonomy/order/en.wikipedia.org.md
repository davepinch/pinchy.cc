excerpt: >-
  **Order** (Latin: ordo) is one of the eight major hierarchical taxonomic ranks in Linnaean taxonomy. It is classified between [family](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)/) and [class](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)/). In biological classification, the order is a [taxonomic rank](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank/) used in the classification of organisms and recognized by the nomenclature codes. An immediately higher rank, superorder, is sometimes added directly above order, with suborder directly beneath order. An order can also be defined as a group of related families.
