  **Ammon** (Ammonite: 𐤏𐤌𐤍 *ʻAmān*; Hebrew: עַמּוֹן ʻAmmōn; Arabic: عمّون, romanized: *ʻAmmūn*) was an ancient Semitic-speaking kingdom occupying the east of the Jordan River, between the torrent valleys of Arnon and Jabbok, in present-day Jordan. The chief city of the country was Rabbah or Rabbat Ammon, site of the modern city of Amman, Jordan's capital. Milcom and Molech are named in the Hebrew Bible as the gods of Ammon. The people of this kingdom are called Children of Ammon or Ammonites.
