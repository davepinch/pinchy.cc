excerpt: >-
  The **Iron Age** is the final epoch of the three historical Metal Ages, after the [Copper](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcolithic/) and [Bronze]((/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age/)) Ages. It has also been considered as the final Age of the three-age division starting with prehistory (before recorded history) and progressing to protohistory (before written history). In this usage, it is preceded by the Stone Age (subdivided into the [Paleolithic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic), Mesolithic and [Neolithic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic/)) and [Bronze Age](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age/). These concepts originated in describing Iron Age Europe and the Ancient Near East, but they now include other parts of the Old World.
