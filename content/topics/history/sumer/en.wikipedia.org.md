excerpt: >-
  **Sumer** (/ˈsuːmər/) is the earliest known civilization in the historical region of southern [Mesopotamia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia) (now south-central Iraq), emerging during the [Chalcolithic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcolithic/) and early [Bronze Ages](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age/) between the sixth and fifth millennium BC. Like nearby Elam, it is one of the cradles of civilization, along with Egypt, the Indus Valley, China, Caral-Supe, and Mesoamerica. Living along the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, Sumerian farmers grew an abundance of grain and other crops, a surplus which enabled them to form urban settlements. The world's earliest known texts come from the Sumerian cities of Uruk and Jemdet Nasr, and date to between c. 3350 – c. 2500 BC, following a period of proto-writing c. 4000 – c. 2500 BC.
