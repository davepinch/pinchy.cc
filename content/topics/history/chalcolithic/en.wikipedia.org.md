excerpt: >-
  The **Chalcolithic** (also called the **Copper Age** and **Eneolithic**) is an archaeological period characterized by the increasing use of smelted [copper](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper/). It follows the [Neolithic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic) and precedes the [Bronze Age](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age). It occurs at different periods in different areas, and is absent in some parts of the world, such as [Russia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia). Stone tools were still predominantly used during this period.
