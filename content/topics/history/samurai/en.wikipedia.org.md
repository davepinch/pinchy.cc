> **Samurai** (侍) were the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from the late 12th century until their abolition in the 1870s during the Meiji era. They were the well-paid retainers of the *daimyo*, the great feudal landholders. They had high prestige and special privileges.
