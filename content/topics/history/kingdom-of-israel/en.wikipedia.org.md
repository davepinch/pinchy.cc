  The **Kingdom of Israel** (Biblical Hebrew: מַמְלֶכֶת יִשְׂרָאֵל‎, romanized: *Mamleḵeṯ Yīśrāʾēl*), **Northern Kingdom** or **Kingdom of Samaria**, was an Israelite kingdom in the Southern Levant during the Iron Age, whose beginnings can be dated back to the first half of the 10th century BCE. The kingdom controlled the areas of Samaria, Galilee and parts of Transjordan. The regions of Samaria and Galilee underwent a period with large number of settlements during the 10th century BCE, with the capital in Shechem, and then in Tirzah. The kingdom was ruled by the Omride dynasty in the 9th century BCE, whose political center was the city of Samaria.
