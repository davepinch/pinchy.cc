excerpt: >-
  **Crime fiction**, **detective story**, **murder mystery**, **mystery novel**, and **police novel** are terms used to describe narratives that centre on criminal acts and especially on the investigation, either by an amateur or a professional detective, of a crime, often a murder. Most crime drama focuses on criminal investigation and does not feature the courtroom. Suspense and mystery are key elements that are nearly ubiquitous to the genre.
