excerpt: >-
  ***Chanbara*** (チャンバラ), also commonly spelled "***chambara***", meaning "sword fighting" films, denotes the Japanese film genre called **samurai cinema** in English and is roughly equivalent to Western and swashbuckler films. *Chanbara* is a sub-category of *jidaigeki*, which equates to period drama. *Jidaigeki* may refer to a story set in a historical period, though not necessarily dealing with a samurai character or depicting swordplay.
