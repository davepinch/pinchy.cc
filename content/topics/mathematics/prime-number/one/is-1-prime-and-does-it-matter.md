"1 of": prime number
author: James Propp
excerpt: >-
  If you ask a person on the street whether 1 is a prime number, they’ll probably pause, try to remember what they were taught, and say “no” (or “yes” or “I don’t remember”). Or maybe they’ll cross the street in a hurry. On the other hand, if you ask a mathematician, there’s a good chance they’ll say “That’s an excellent question” or “It’s kind of an interesting story…”
