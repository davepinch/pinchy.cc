excerpt: >-
  In mathematics, **summation** is the addition of a sequence of numbers, called *addends* or *summands*; the result is their sum or total. Beside numbers, other types of values can be summed as well: functions, vectors, matrices, polynomials and, in general, elements of any type of mathematical objects on which an operation denoted "+" is defined.
