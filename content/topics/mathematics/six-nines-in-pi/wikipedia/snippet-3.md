  This sequence of six nines is sometimes called the "Feynman point", after physicist Richard Feynman, who allegedly stated this same idea in a lecture. However it is not clear when, or even if, Feynman made such a statement. It is not mentioned in published biographies or in his autobiographies, and is unknown to his biographer, James Gleick.
