excerpt: >-
  In plane Euclidean [geometry](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry), a rhombus (plural rhombi or rhombuses) is a [quadrilateral](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateral) whose four sides all have the same length. Another name is equilateral quadrilateral, since equilateral means that all of its sides are equal in length. The rhombus is often called a "diamond", after the diamonds suit in playing cards which resembles the projection of an octahedral diamond, or a lozenge, though the former sometimes refers specifically to a rhombus with a 60° angle (which some authors call a calisson after the French sweet – also see Polyiamond), and the latter sometimes refers specifically to a rhombus with a 45° angle.
