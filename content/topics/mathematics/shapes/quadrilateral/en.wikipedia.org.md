  In [geometry](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry/) a **quadrilateral** is a four-sided [polygon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon/), having four edges (sides) and four corners (vertices). The word is derived from the Latin words quadri, a variant of four, and latus, meaning "side". It is also called a tetragon, derived from greek "tetra" meaning "four" and "gon" meaning "corner" or "angle", in analogy to other polygons (e.g. [pentagon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon/)). Since "gon" means "angle", it is analogously called a quadrangle, or 4-angle. A quadrilateral with vertices A, B, C and D is sometimes denoted as ABCD.
