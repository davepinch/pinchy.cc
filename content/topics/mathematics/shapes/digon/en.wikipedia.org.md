excerpt: >-
  In [geometry](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry/), a **bigon**, **digon**, or a **2-gon**, is a [polygon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon/) with two sides (edges) and two vertices. Its construction is degenerate in a Euclidean plane because either the two sides would coincide or one or both would have to be curved; however, it can be easily visualised in elliptic space. It may also be viewed as a representation of a graph with two vertices, see "Generalized polygon".
