excerpt: >-
  A **regular octahedron** is an octahedron that is a regular polyhedron. All the faces of a regular octahedron are equilateral triangles of the same size, and exactly four triangles meet at each vertex. A regular octahedron is convex, meaning that for any two points within it, the line segment connecting them lies entirely within it.
