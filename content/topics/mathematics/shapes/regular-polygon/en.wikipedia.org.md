excerpt: >-
  In Euclidean geometry, a **regular polygon** is a [polygon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon/) that is direct equiangular (all angles are equal in measure) and equilateral (all sides have the same length). Regular polygons may be either convex, star or skew. In the limit, a sequence of regular polygons with an increasing number of sides approximates a circle, if the perimeter or area is fixed, or a regular apeirogon (effectively a straight line), if the edge length is fixed.
