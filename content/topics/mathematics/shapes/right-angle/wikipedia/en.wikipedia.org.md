excerpt: >-
  In geometry and trigonometry, a **right angle** is an angle of exactly 90 degrees or 𝜋/2 radians corresponding to a quarter turn. If a ray is placed so that its endpoint is on a line and the adjacent angles are equal, then they are right angles. The term is a calque of Latin *angulus rectus*; here rectus means "upright", referring to the vertical perpendicular to a horizontal base line.
