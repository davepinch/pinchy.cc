excerpt: >-
  A **regular tetrahedron** is a tetrahedron in which all four faces are equilateral triangles. In other words, all of its faces are the same size and shape (congruent) and all edges are the same length. A convex polyhedron in which all of its faces are equilateral triangles is the deltahedron. There are eight convex deltahedra, one of which is the regular tetrahedron.
