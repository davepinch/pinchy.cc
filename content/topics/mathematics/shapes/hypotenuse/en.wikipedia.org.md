excerpt: >-
  In geometry, a **hypotenuse** is the side of a right triangle opposite the right angle. It is the longest side of any such triangle; the two other shorter sides of such a triangle are called catheti or legs. The length of the hypotenuse can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two legs. Mathematically, this can be written as *𝑎^2 + 𝑏^2 = 𝑐^2*, where *a* is the length of one leg, *b* is the length of another leg, and *c* is the length of the hypotenuse.
