excerpt: >-
  In a right triangle, a **cathetus** (originally from the Greek word Κάθετος; plural: **catheti**), commonly known as a **leg**, is either of the sides that are adjacent to the right angle. It is occasionally called a "side about the right angle". The side opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse. In the context of the hypotenuse, the catheti are sometimes referred to simply as "the other two sides".
