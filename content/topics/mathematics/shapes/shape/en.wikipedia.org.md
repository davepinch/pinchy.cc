excerpt: >-
  A **shape** is a graphical representation of an object's form or its external boundary, outline, or external surface. It is distinct from other object properties, such as color, texture, or material type. In geometry, shape excludes information about the object's location, scale, orientation and reflection. A **figure** is a representation including both shape and size (as in, e.g., figure of the Earth).
