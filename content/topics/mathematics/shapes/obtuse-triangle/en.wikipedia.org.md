excerpt: >-
  An **obtuse triangle** (or **obtuse-angled triangle**) is a [triangle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle/) with one obtuse angle (greater than 90°) and two acute angles. Since a triangle's angles must sum to 180° in Euclidean geometry, no Euclidean triangle can have more than one obtuse angle.
