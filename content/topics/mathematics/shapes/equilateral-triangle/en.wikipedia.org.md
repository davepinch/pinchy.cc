excerpt: >-
  In geometry, an **equilateral triangle** is a [triangle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle/) in which all three sides have the same length. In the familiar Euclidean geometry, an equilateral triangle is also equiangular; that is, all three internal angles are also congruent to each other and are each 60°. It is also a regular polygon, so it is also referred to as a regular triangle.
