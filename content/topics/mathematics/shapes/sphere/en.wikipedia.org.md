  A **sphere** (from Greek σφαῖρα, sphaîra) is a geometrical object that is a three-dimensional analogue to a two-dimensional [circle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle/). Formally, a sphere is the set of points that are all at the same distance r from a given point in three-dimensional space. That given point is the center of the sphere, and r is the sphere's radius. The earliest known mentions of spheres appear in the work of the ancient Greek mathematicians.
