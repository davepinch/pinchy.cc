title: "Triangle of Power Notation and Logarithms (mathcenter.oxford.emory.edu)"
excerpt: >-
  When it comes to the relationship ab=c, we have examined how c can be thought of as a combination of a and b. We have also considered the implications of thinking of a as a combination of b and c. There is one more possible combination we could contemplate -- what happens if we view b as a combination of a and c?
