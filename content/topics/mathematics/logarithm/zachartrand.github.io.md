title: "How does a computer/calculator compute logarithms? (zachartrand.github.io)"
excerpt: >-
  There are many functions on a scientific or graphing calculator that we are introduced to as high school students that, we are told, just work. You select the function, put in the value that you need to calculate, hit “=” or “ENTER”, and SHABAM! You have the correct answer to some arbitrary number of digits that you are ensured are all 100% accurate.
