  **Elementary algebra**, also known as **college algebra**, encompasses the basic concepts of [algebra](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra/). It is often contrasted with [arithmetic](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic/): arithmetic deals with specified numbers, whilst algebra introduces variables (quantities without fixed values).
