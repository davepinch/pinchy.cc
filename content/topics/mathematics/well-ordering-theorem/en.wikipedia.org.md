  In mathematics, the **well-ordering theorem**, also known as **Zermelo's theorem**, states that every set can be well-ordered. A set X is well-ordered by a strict total order if every non-empty subset of X has a least element under the ordering. The well-ordering theorem together with Zorn's lemma are the most important mathematical statements that are equivalent to the [axiom of choice](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice/) (often called AC, see also Axiom of choice § Equivalents). [Ernst Zermelo](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Zermelo/) introduced the axiom of choice as an "unobjectionable logical principle" to prove the well-ordering theorem. One can conclude from the well-ordering theorem that every set is susceptible to transfinite induction, which is considered by mathematicians to be a powerful technique. One famous consequence of the theorem is the Banach–Tarski paradox.
