excerpt: >-
  In mathematics, the **von Neumann paradox**, named after [John von Neumann](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann/), is the idea that one can break a planar figure such as the unit square into sets of points and subject each set to an area-preserving affine transformation such that the result is two planar figures of the same size as the original. This was proved in 1929 by John von Neumann, assuming the [axiom of choice](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice/). It is based on the earlier Banach–Tarski paradox, which is in turn based on the Hausdorff paradox.
