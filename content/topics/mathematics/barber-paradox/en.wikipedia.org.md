excerpt: >-
  The **barber paradox** is a puzzle derived from [Russell's paradox](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_paradox). It was used by [Bertrand Russell](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell) as an illustration of the paradox, though he attributes it to an unnamed person who suggested it to him. The puzzle shows that an apparently plausible scenario is logically impossible. Specifically, it describes a barber who is defined such that he both shaves himself and does not shave himself, which implies that no such barber exists.
