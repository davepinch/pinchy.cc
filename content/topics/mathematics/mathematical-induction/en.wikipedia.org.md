excerpt: >-
  Mathematical induction is a method for proving that a statement P(n) is true for every [natural number](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number/) n, that is, that the infinitely many cases P(0), P(1), P(2), P(3),... all hold. This is done by first proving a simple case, then also showing that if we assume the claim is true for a given case, then the next case is also true.
