An explanation of [Russell's Paradox](/russells-paradox/) by Jeffrey Kaplan:

> This is a video lecture explaining Russell's Paradox. At the very heart of logic and [mathematics](/mathematics/), there is a paradox that has yet to be resolved. It was discovered by the mathematician and philosopher, [Bertrand Russell](/bertrand-russell/), in 1901. In this talk, Professor Jeffrey Kaplan teaches you the basics of set theory (a foundational branch of mathematics dating back to the 1870s) in 20 minutes. Then he explains Russellâ€™s Paradox, which is quite a thrilling thing if you are learning it for the first time. Finally, Kaplan argues that the paradox goes even deeper than Russell himself realized.
