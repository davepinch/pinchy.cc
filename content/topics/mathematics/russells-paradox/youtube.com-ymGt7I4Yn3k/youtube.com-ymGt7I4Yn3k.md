An explanation of [Russell's Paradox](/russells-paradox/) by Jeffrey Kaplan:

> This is a video lecture explaining Russell's Paradox. At the very heart of logic and [mathematics](/mathematics/), there is a paradox that has yet to be resolved. It was discovered by the mathematician and philosopher, [Bertrand Russell](/bertrand-russell/), in 1901. In this talk, Professor Jeffrey Kaplan teaches you the basics of set theory (a foundational branch of mathematics dating back to the 1870s) in 20 minutes. Then he explains Russell’s Paradox, which is quite a thrilling thing if you are learning it for the first time. Finally, Kaplan argues that the paradox goes even deeper than Russell himself realized.
