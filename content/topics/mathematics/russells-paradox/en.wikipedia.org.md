excerpt: >-
  In mathematical logic, **Russell's paradox** (also known as **Russell's antinomy**) is a set-theoretic paradox published by the British philosopher and mathematician [Bertrand Russell](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell/) in 1901. Russell's paradox shows that every set theory that contains an unrestricted comprehension principle leads to contradictions. The paradox had already been discovered independently in 1899 by the German mathematician Ernst Zermelo. However, Zermelo did not publish the idea, which remained known only to David Hilbert, Edmund Husserl, and other academics at the University of Göttingen. At the end of the 1890s, Georg Cantor – considered the founder of modern set theory – had already realized that his theory would lead to a contradiction, as he told Hilbert and Richard Dedekind by letter.
