title: "I wrote to the address in the GPLv2 license notice and received the GPLv3 license (code.mendhak.com)"

excerpt: >-
  Dealing with open source software, I regularly encounter many kinds of licenses — MIT, Apache, BSD, GPL being the most prominent — and I’ve taken time out to read them. Of the many, the GNU General Public License (GPL) stands out the most. It reads like a letter to the reader rather than legalese, and feels quite in tune with the spirit of open source and software freedom.
