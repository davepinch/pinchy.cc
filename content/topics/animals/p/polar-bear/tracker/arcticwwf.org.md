excerpt: >-
  Follow polar bears as we track them across the vast white desert of the Arctic Ocean. With the help of polar bear researchers, WWF is following the bears’ travels in the Arctic. Their positions are beamed from collars on the bears’ necks, via satellite to scientists, and then to this site. It allows us to get regular updates about how the polar bears behave in their Arctic environment and how they may be affected by climate change.
