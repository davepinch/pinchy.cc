  The **Africanized bee**, also known as the **Africanized honey bee** (**AHB**) and colloquially as the "**killer bee**", is a hybrid of the western honey bee (Apis mellifera), produced originally by crossbreeding of the East African lowland honey bee (A. m. scutellata) with various European honey bee subspecies such as the Italian honey bee (A. m. ligustica) and the Iberian honey bee (A. m. iberiensis).
