excerpt: >-
  People pronounce "coyote" at least five different ways. It differs by region, age, and even social factors. Some people even pronounce it different ways when they mean different things by it.
note: Tonight (August 15, 2024) I was listening to a YouTube video with Mary and we heard the speaker pronounce coyote as "kai-oat". At first we thought this revealed the speaker was AI, but it turns out some people do pronounce it differently.
