title: "Four corners of the world (Wikipedia)"
excerpt: >-
  Several cosmological and mythological systems portray **four corners of the world** or **four quarters of the world** corresponding approximately to the four points of the compass (or the two solstices and two equinoxes). At the center may lie a sacred mountain, garden, world tree, or other beginning-point of creation. Often four rivers run to the four corners of the world, and water or irrigate the four quadrants of Earth.
