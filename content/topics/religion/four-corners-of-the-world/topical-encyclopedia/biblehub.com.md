title: "The Four Corners of the Earth (biblehub.com)"
excerpt: >-
  The phrase "the four corners of the earth" is a biblical expression that appears in several passages of Scripture, often used to denote the entirety of the earth or the whole world. This expression is understood metaphorically, as the Bible frequently employs figurative language to convey spiritual truths and concepts. The phrase is not intended to suggest a literal, flat earth with physical corners, but rather to emphasize the universality and completeness of God's creation and sovereignty.
