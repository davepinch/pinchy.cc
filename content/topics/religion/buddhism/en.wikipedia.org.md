  **Buddhism** (/ˈbʊdɪzəm/ *BUU-dih-zəm*, US also /ˈbuːd-/ *BOOD-*), also known as **Buddha Dharma**, ***Bauddha*** and **Dharmavinaya** (transl. "doctrines and disciplines"), is an Indian religion or philosophical tradition based on teachings attributed to the Buddha. It originated in present-day North India as a śramaṇa–movement in the 5th century BCE, and gradually spread throughout much of Asia via the Silk Road. It is the world's fourth-largest religion, with over 520 million followers (**Buddhists**) who comprise seven percent of the global population.
