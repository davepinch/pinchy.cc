excerpt: >-
  **Kabbalah** (Hebrew: קַבָּלָה *Qabbālā*, literally "reception, tradition") is an esoteric method, discipline and school of thought in Jewish mysticism. A traditional Kabbalist is called a **Mekubbal** (מְקוּבָּל‎ Məqūbbāl "receiver"). The definition of Kabbalah varies according to the tradition and aims of those following it, from its origin in medieval Judaism to its later adaptations in Western esotericism (Christian Kabbalah and Hermetic Qabalah). Jewish Kabbalah is a set of esoteric teachings meant to explain the relationship between the unchanging, eternal God—the mysterious *Ein Sof* (אֵין סוֹף‎, *"The Infinite"*)—and the mortal, finite universe (God's creation). It forms the foundation of mystical religious interpretations within Judaism.
