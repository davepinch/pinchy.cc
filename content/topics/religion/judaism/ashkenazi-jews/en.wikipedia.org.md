excerpt: >-
  **Ashkenazi Jews** (/ˌɑːʃkəˈnɑːzi, ˌæʃ-/ *A(H)SH-kə-NAH-zee*; Hebrew: יְהוּדֵי אַשְׁכְּנַז, romanized: *Yehudei Ashkenaz*, lit. 'Jews of Germania'; Yiddish: אַשכּנזישע ייִדן, romanized: *Ashkenazishe Yidn*), also known as Ashkenazic Jews or Ashkenazim, constitute a Jewish diaspora population that emerged in the Holy Roman Empire around the end of the first millennium CE. They traditionally spoke Yiddish and largely migrated towards northern and eastern Europe during the late Middle Ages due to persecution. Hebrew was primarily used as a literary and sacred language until its 20th-century revival as a common language in Israel.
