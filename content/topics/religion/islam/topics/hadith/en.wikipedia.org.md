  ***Ḥadīth*** (/ˈhædɪθ/ or /hɑːˈdiːθ/; Arabic: حديث, *ḥadīṯ*, Arabic pronunciation: [ħadiːθ]; pl. ***aḥādīth***, أحاديث, *ʾaḥādīṯ*, Arabic pronunciation: [ʔaħaːdiːθ], lit. 'talk' or 'discourse') or **Athar** (Arabic: أثر, ʾAṯar, lit. 'remnant' or 'effect') refers to what most Muslims and the mainstream schools of Islamic thought believe to be a record of the words, actions, and the silent approval of the Islamic prophet [Muhammad](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad/) as transmitted through chains of narrators. In other words, the ḥadīth are attributed reports about what Muhammad said and did (see: Oral tradition).
