excerpt: >-
  According to the Book of Numbers, Taberah (Hebrew: תבערה) is one of the locations which the Israelites passed through during their Exodus journey. The biblical narrative states that the place received its name, which means the pӀace of burning, because the fire of the LORD had burned there in anger because of their continued complaints. The text states that the fire first burned at the outskirts of the Israelite camp, killing some of those who lived on the edge of the group, but it was extinguished when Moses prayed on the people's behalf.
