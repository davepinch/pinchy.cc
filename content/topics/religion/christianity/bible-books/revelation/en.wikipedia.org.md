excerpt: >-
  The **Book of Revelation**, also erroneously called the **Book of Revelations**, is the final book of the New Testament (and therefore the final book of the Christian Bible). Written in Koine Greek, its title is derived from the first word of the text: apokalypsis, meaning 'unveiling' or 'revelation'. The Book of Revelation is the only apocalyptic book in the [New Testament](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament/) canon. It occupies a central place in Christian eschatology.
