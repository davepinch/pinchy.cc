  Isaiah 17:3 (KJV) foretells the downfall of Damascus (Syria) and Ephraim (the northern kingdom of Israel) as a consequence of their disobedience to God. It declares that Ephraim's strongholds will fail, Damascus will lose its sovereignty, and Syria will be left with only a humbled remnant. The verse draws a parallel between Syria's decline and Israel’s diminished glory, emphasizing that both nations will suffer the consequences of relying on worldly power rather than God. It serves as a warning of divine judgment and a call to repentance.
