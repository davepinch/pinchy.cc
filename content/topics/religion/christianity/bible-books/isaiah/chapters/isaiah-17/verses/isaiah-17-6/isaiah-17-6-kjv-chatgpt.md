  Isaiah 17:6 uses the imagery of a beaten olive tree to convey that, despite the impending judgment and destruction of Damascus (Syria), a small remnant will survive, symbolized by the few olives left on the tree after harvest. This "gleaning" signifies that God's judgment, though severe, will not result in complete annihilation, as a small group will endure. The verse reflects the broader theme in Isaiah that, even in times of judgment, God preserves a faithful remnant, offering hope alongside the promise of restoration.
