  Isaiah 17:2 in the KJV speaks of the desolation of the cities of Aroer, located east of the Jordan River. The verse prophesies that these cities will be abandoned, with flocks grazing peacefully in the area, undisturbed by human presence or fear. This destruction symbolizes the total judgment and devastation that will come upon the region, reflecting God's sovereignty and the consequences of political turmoil. While it suggests a peace in the land after the destruction, it also highlights the severity of the divine judgment on the nations involved.
