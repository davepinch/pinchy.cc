  Isaiah 17:11 contrasts initial prosperity with a future of destruction, symbolizing the fleeting nature of earthly success. The "plant" and "seed" represent growth and abundance, but the verse warns that despite early flourishing, the final outcome will be a "heap" of grief and sorrow, signaling judgment and loss. It emphasizes that outward signs of prosperity can be deceptive, as divine judgment or calamity can turn what seems promising into ruin.
