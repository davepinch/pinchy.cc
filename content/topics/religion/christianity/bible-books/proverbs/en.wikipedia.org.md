excerpt: >-
  The **Book of Proverbs** (Hebrew: מִשְלֵי, *Mišlê*; Greek: Παροιμίαι; Latin: *Liber Proverbiorum*, "Proverbs (of Solomon)") is a book in the third section (called Ketuvim) of the Hebrew Bible traditionally ascribed to King Solomon and his students later appearing in the Christian [Old Testament](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament/). When translated into Greek and Latin, the title took on different forms: in the Greek Septuagint (LXX) it became Παροιμίαι (*Paroimiai*, "Proverbs"); in the Latin Vulgate the title was *Proverbia*, from which the English name is derived.
