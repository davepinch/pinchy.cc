excerpt: >-
  The **Book of Leviticus** (/lɪˈvɪtɪkəs/, from Ancient Greek: Λευιτικόν, *Leuïtikón*; Biblical Hebrew: וַיִּקְרָא‎, *Wayyīqrāʾ*, 'And He called'; Latin: Liber Leviticus) is the third book of the Torah (the Pentateuch) and of the Old Testament, also known as the Third Book of Moses. Many hypotheses presented by scholars as to its origins agree that it developed over a long period of time, reaching its present form during the Persian Period, from 538 to 332 BC, although this is disputed.
