  The **Book of Malachi** (Hebrew: מַלְאָכִ֔י, Malʾāḵī) is the last book of the Neviim contained in the Tanakh, canonically the last of the Twelve Minor Prophets. In most Christian orderings, the grouping of the prophetic books is the last section of the [Old Testament](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament/), making Malachi the last book before the [New Testament](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament/).
