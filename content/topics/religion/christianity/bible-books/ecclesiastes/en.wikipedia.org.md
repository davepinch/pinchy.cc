excerpt: >-
  **Ecclesiastes** (/ɪˌkliːziˈæstiːz/, *ih-KLEE-zee-ASS-teez*; Biblical Hebrew: קֹהֶלֶת, romanized: *Qōheleṯ*, Ancient Greek: Ἐκκλησιαστής, romanized: Ekklēsiastēs) is one of the Ketuvim ("Writings") of the Hebrew Bible and part of the Wisdom literature of the Christian [Old Testament](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament/). The title commonly used in English is a Latin transliteration of the Greek translation of the Hebrew word קֹהֶלֶת (*Kohelet*, *Koheleth*, *Qoheleth* or *Qohelet*). An unnamed author introduces "The words of Kohelet, son of David, king in Jerusalem" (1:1) and does not use his own voice again until the final verses (12:9–14), where he gives his own thoughts and summarises the statements of **Kohelet**; the main body of the text is ascribed to Kohelet himself.
fahrenheit-451: "In the dystopian novel Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury's main character, Montag, memorizes much of Ecclesiastes and Revelation in a world where books are forbidden and burned."
