excerpt: >-
  The **First Epistle of John** is the first of the Johannine epistles of the [New Testament](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament/), and the fourth of the catholic epistles. There is no scholarly consensus as to the authorship of the Johannine works. The author of the First Epistle is termed John the Evangelist, who most modern scholars believe is not the same as John the Apostle. Most scholars believe the three Johannine epistles have the same author, but there is no consensus if this was also the author of the [Gospel of John](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_John/).
