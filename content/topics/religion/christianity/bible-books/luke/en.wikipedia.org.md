book of: New Testament (Wikipedia)
excerpt: >-
  The **Gospel of Luke** tells of the origins, birth, ministry, death, resurrection, and ascension of [Jesus Christ](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus/). Together with the Acts of the Apostles, it makes up a two-volume work which scholars call Luke–Acts, accounting for 27.5% of the [New Testament](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament/). The combined work divides the history of first-century Christianity into three stages, with the gospel making up the first two of these – the life of Jesus the Messiah from his birth to the beginning of his mission in the meeting with John the Baptist, followed by his ministry with events such as the Sermon on the Plain and its Beatitudes, and his Passion, death, and resurrection.
