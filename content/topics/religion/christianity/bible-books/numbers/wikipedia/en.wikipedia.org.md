excerpt: >-
  The **Book of Numbers** (from Greek Ἀριθμοί, *Arithmoi*, lit. 'numbers'; Biblical Hebrew: בְּמִדְבַּר, *Bəmīḏbar*, lit. 'In [the] desert'; Latin: *Liber Numeri*) is the fourth book of the Hebrew Bible and the fourth of five books of the Jewish Torah. The book has a long and complex history; its final form is possibly due to a Priestly redaction (i.e., editing) of a Yahwistic source made sometime in the early Persian period (5th century BC). The name of the book comes from the two censuses taken of the Israelites.
