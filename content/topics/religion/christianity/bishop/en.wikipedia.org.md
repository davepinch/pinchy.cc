excerpt: >-
  A **bishop** is an ordained member of the clergy who is entrusted with a position of authority and oversight in a religious institution. In Christianity, bishops are normally responsible for the governance and administration of [dioceses](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese/). The role or office of the bishop is called **episcopacy**. Organizationally, several Christian denominations utilize ecclesiastical structures that call for the position of bishops, while other denominations have dispensed with this office, seeing it as a symbol of power. Bishops have also exercised political authority within their dioceses.
