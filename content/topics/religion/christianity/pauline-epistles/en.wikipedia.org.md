  The **Pauline epistles**, also known as Epistles of Paul or Letters of Paul, are the thirteen books of the [New Testament](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament/) attributed to [Paul the Apostle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle/), although the authorship of some is in dispute. Among these epistles are some of the earliest extant Christian documents. They provide an insight into the beliefs and controversies of early Christianity. As part of the canon of the New Testament, they are foundational texts for both Christian theology and ethics.
