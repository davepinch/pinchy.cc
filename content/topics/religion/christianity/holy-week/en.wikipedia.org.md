  **Holy Week** (Koinē Greek: Ἁγία καὶ Μεγάλη Ἑβδομάς, romanized: *Hagía kaì Megálē Hebdomás*, lit. 'Holy and Great Week') is the most sacred week in the liturgical year in Christianity. For all Christian traditions, it is a moveable observance. In Eastern Christianity, which also calls it Great Week, it is the week following Great Lent and Lazarus Saturday, starting on the evening of Palm Sunday and concluding on the evening of Great Saturday. In Western Christianity, Holy Week is the sixth and last week of Lent, beginning with Palm Sunday and concluding on Holy Saturday.
