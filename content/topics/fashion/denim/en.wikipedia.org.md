excerpt: >-
  **Denim** is a sturdy cotton warp-faced textile in which the [weft](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_and_weft/) passes under two or more warp threads. This twill weave produces a diagonal ribbing that distinguishes it from cotton duck. Denim, as it is recognized today, was first produced in NÃ®mes, France.
