title: "Castlevania III Draculas Curse (castlevaniagames.net)"
excerpt: >-
  Dracula and his evil armies have been rampaging through Europe. Only the Belmont family can stop him! This game is oddly named Draculas curse. I thought Simon had just been cursed before Castlevania II? Whatever. This game abandons the RPG like elements of Castlevania II and returns to the good old days of Castlevania and simple action and adventure. This game is non-linear though and you will choose different paths at multiple points in the game. Trevor Belmont is the main character but he can be joined by 3 different characters (you choose) - Alucard, Grant, and Sypha. Choosing your own paths and support characters makes this game stand out. It is also MUCH harder than Castlevania I.
