excerpt: >-
  Released in 1986, Castlevania launched a legendary series of games starring Simon Belmont. Make your way through the 6 stages of Draculas Castle before facing Dracula himself in an epic battle. The stages of Draculas Castle are all part of a larger map and you can see a basic layout of what lies ahead. This game is fairly easy for the first 3 stages but then the difficulty ramps up. Stage 4 with its creepy underground and Frankenstein boss will challenge even veteran gamers. The Grim Reaper is arguably one of the toughest bosses - unless you have the Holy Water that is. And Dracula himself is a horrible pain to beat. You will have to beat him twice and hope you get lucky!
