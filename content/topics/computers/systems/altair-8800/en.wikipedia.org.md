  The **Altair 8800** is a microcomputer designed in 1974 by MITS and based on the [Intel 8080](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080/) CPU. Interest grew quickly after it was featured on the cover of the January 1975 issue of *Popular Electronics* and was sold by mail order through advertisements there, in Radio-Electronics, and in other hobbyist magazines. According to Harry Garland, the Altair 8800 was the product that catalyzed the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s. It was the first commercially successful personal computer. The computer bus designed for the Altair was to become a de facto standard in the form of the S-100 bus, and the first programming language for the machine was [Microsoft](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft/)'s founding product, [Altair BASIC](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_BASIC/).
