excerpt: >-
  The **Mark-8** is a microcomputer design from 1974, based on the Intel 8008 CPU (which was the world's first 8-bit microprocessor). The Mark-8 was designed by Jonathan Titus, a Virginia Tech graduate student in chemistry. After building the machine, Titus decided to share its design with the community and reached out to *Radio-Electronics* and *Popular Electronics*. He was turned down by *Popular Electronics*, but *Radio-Electronics* was interested and announced the Mark-8 as a 'loose kit' in the July 1974 issue of Radio-Electronics magazine.
