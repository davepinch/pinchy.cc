title: "BUILD THE MARK 8 - Radio Electronics July 1974 (classiccmp.org)"
excerpt: >-
  The Radio-Electronics Mark-8 Mini-computer is a complete microcomputer which may be used for a number of purposes, including data acquisition, data manipulation and control of experiments. It may also be used to send data to a larger computer or to a terminal such as the Radio-Electronics TV Typewriter, (September 1973) and it is easily interfaced with a keyboard. The keyboards do not have to be ASCII encoded since the microcomputer itself can convert the input code to an equivalent ASCII code for output. This Minicomputer is not a glorified calculator and it is not intended just for educational use. It can be interfaced to a calculator (a possible future project if readers are interested) to perform complex mathematical routines, and it may also be used as a teaching tool.
