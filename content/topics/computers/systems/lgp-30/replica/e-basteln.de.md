title: "An FPGA-based LGP-30 Replica (e-basteln.de)"
excerpt: >-
  This page describes a replica that is true to the bit-serial implementation and its timing, but uses modern components. The CPU and the magnetic drum storage are recreated in an FPGA – by implementing the complete logic equations published by the LGP-30’s inventor (in a scientific paper and in the computer’s service manual). The magnetic drum, while implemented in on-board memory inside the FPGA, is made tangible via an optional video display of its contents.
