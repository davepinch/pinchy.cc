title: "Apple II Vapor Lock and the Floating Bus (deater.net)"
excerpt: >-
  First, I want to make it clear I didn't invent any of this. It has been well known since the early 80s. You can read more about this in Bob Bishop's 1982 Softalk article "Have an Apple Split" and Don Lancaster's Vapor Lock and Fun with Mixed Fields and Glitch Stomper articles. The technique was really not used that much, probably because it is difficult to use and not really officially supported by Apple.
