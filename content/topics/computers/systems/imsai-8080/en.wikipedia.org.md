excerpt: >-
  The **IMSAI 8080** is an early microcomputer released in late 1975, based on the Intel 8080 (and later 8085) and S-100 bus. It is a clone of its main competitor, the earlier MITS Altair 8800. The IMSAI is largely regarded as the first "clone" microcomputer. The IMSAI machine runs a highly modified version of the CP/M operating system called IMDOS. It was developed, manufactured and sold by IMS Associates, Inc. (later renamed to IMSAI Manufacturing Corp). In total, between 17,000 and 20,000 units were produced from 1975 to 1978.
