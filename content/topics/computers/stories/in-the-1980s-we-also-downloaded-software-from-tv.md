title: "In the 1980s we also downloaded software from TV (newslttrs.com)"
excerpt: >-
  In the previous newslttr, I wrote about downloading software from radio broadcasts in the 1980s. It sparked some lively conversation on Hacker News which also brought up some other 80s software oddities. One obvious parallel was with software downloads via TV broadcast which is the subject of today's trip down 8k Memory Lane.
