  SPECIAL NOTE: 86—DOS is not related to the popular CP/M operating system of Digital Research. Disk directory formatting and space allocation are completely different and incompatible. 86—DOS does, however, provide a utility called RDCPM which will transfer files from CP/M disks to 86—DOS disks. Further, operating system calls and calling conventions have been provided which make possible automatic translation of Z80 programs written for CP/M into 8086 programs that run under 86—DOS.
