  **MS-DOS** (/ˌɛmˌɛsˈdɒs/ em-es-DOSS; acronym for **Microsoft Disk Operating System**, also known as **Microsoft DOS**) is an operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by [Microsoft](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft/). Collectively, MS-DOS, its rebranding as IBM PC DOS, and a few operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS, are sometimes referred to as "DOS" (which is also the generic acronym for disk operating system). MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatibles during the 1980s, from which point it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system.
