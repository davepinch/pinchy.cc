excerpt: >-
  David Neil Cutler Sr was born on the 13th of March in 1942 in Lansing, Michigan. He was interested in sports as a young man growing up in Dewitt, and received a scholarship for his athleticism to Olivet College. An injury ended his sports playing and forced him to reevaluate his future. He was interested in math and physics, but he preferred hands-on work; a preference he would keep for the rest of his life. As a result, he chose engineering. Cutler graduated from Olivet College in 1965, and shortly thereafter went to work for DuPont. Initially, Cutler wasn’t much of computer guy. That is to say, at that time he wouldn’t have been a reader of this publication. Despite computers not being his interest, his job at DuPont required him to use them. He was working with IBM’s GPSS-3 language on an IBM model 7044 developing computer models of the Scott Paper company’s foam production process. Working on this project, he became more interested in how the computer worked than how the model worked. This exposure sparked his interest in operating systems enough that he joined Digital Equipment Corporation in 1971.
