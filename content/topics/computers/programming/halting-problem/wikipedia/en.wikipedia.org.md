excerpt: >-
  In computability theory, the **halting problem** is the problem of determining, from a description of an arbitrary computer program and an input, whether the program will finish running, or continue to run forever. The halting problem is undecidable, meaning that no general algorithm exists that solves the halting problem for all possible programâ€“input pairs. The problem comes up often in discussions of computability since it demonstrates that some functions are mathematically definable but not computable.
