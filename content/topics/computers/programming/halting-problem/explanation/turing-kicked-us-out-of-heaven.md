excerpt: >-
  The **halting problem** is "undecidable": there's no algorithm which can tell you if an arbitrary program with an arbitrary input will halt or not. IE, if you give me a proposed "halt-detector", I can inspect it and come up with a program and input for which it would give the wrong answer.
