excerpt: >-
  Many people ask me for documentation on my modem protocol, i.e. the one used in  the various modem programs in CPMUG, on volumes 6, 25, 40, 47... so here it is.  At the request of Rick Mallinak on behalf of the guys at Standard Oil with IBM P.C.s, as well as several previous requests, I finally decided to put my modem protocol into writing.  It had been previously formally published only in the AMRAD newsletter.
