  cURL is the name of the project. The name is a play on 'Client for URLs', originally with URL spelled in uppercase to make it obvious it deals with URLs. The fact it can also be read as 'see URL' also helped, it works as an abbreviation for "Client URL Request Library" or why not the recursive version: "curl URL Request Library".
