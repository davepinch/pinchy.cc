title: "On the Trail of the Oregon Trail, Part 1 (filfre.net)"
description: This is the first of a series of blog posts on getting the original version of *The Oregon Trail* running in a simulator, along with a bit of history.
excerpt: >-
  I recently got a copy of 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die. Itâ€™s not really a very good book, for reasons that are interesting on their own and that I hope to talk about in another post very soon. Right now, though, I want to talk about the very first entry in the book, on The Oregon Trail, because that entry sent me down a rabbit hole from which I have only just emerged, blinking and reconsidering the history of interactive narrative.
