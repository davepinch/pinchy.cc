  Hello, and welcome to CSS Hell, where you will be subjected to 15 unimaginably torturous CSS puzzles. "What did I do to deserve this?", you ask. But you know perfectly well: you blashpemized Cascading Style Sheets. I saw that time your friends were complaining about CSS and you piled on with "CSS isn't even a real programming language". It is. I saw you upvote that Reddit meme about vertically aligning a div. Just use a flexbox. I saw you chuckle sensibly at those CSS Is Awesome designs. I couldn't stand to let HÃ¥kon Wium Lie's divine creation be slandered in this way, so I decided to show the nonbelievers like you the wrath of CSS's unhinged power.
