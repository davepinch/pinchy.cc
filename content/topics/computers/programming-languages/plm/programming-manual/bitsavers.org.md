title: "PL/M-80 Programming Manual (bitsavers.org)"
excerpt: >-
  A PL/M program is a sequence of PL/M statements. The PL/M-80 Compiler accepts the statements as input and produces a machine-code program module as output. As will be seen in the remainder of this chapter, a PL/M statement may be translated by the compiler into a single 8080 instruction, or a sequence of instructions, or none at all--it may cause the compiler to allocate storage, for example, instead of producing any machine instructions.
