excerpt: >-
  **GW-BASIC** is a dialect of the BASIC programming language developed by [Microsoft](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft/) from IBM BASICA. Functionally identical to BASICA, its BASIC interpreter is a fully self-contained executable and does not need the Cassette BASIC ROM found in the original IBM PC. It was bundled with MS-DOS operating systems on IBM PC compatibles by Microsoft.
