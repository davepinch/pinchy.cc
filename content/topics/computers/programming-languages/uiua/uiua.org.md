excerpt: >-
  Uiua (wee-wuh) is a general purpose, stack-based, array-oriented programming language with a focus on simplicity, beauty, and tacit code. Uiua lets you write code that is as short as possible while remaining readable, so you can focus on problems rather than ceremony. The language is not yet stable, as its design space is still being explored. However, it is already quite powerful and fun to use!
