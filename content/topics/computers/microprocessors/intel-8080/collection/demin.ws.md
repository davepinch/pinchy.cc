collection of: Intel 8080
excerpt: >-
  I started programming twenty year ago coding in machine codes for Intel 8080. This microprocessor was my lucky pass to the fascinating world of bits and bytes. Years later developing various emulators of i8080 and tackling with undocumented and partially documented features of this processor I decided to collect real chips from different manufacturers and examine them using the 8080 CPU Exerciser.
