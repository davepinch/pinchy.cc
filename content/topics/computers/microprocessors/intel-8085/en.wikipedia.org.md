excerpt: >-
  The **Intel 8085** ("*eighty-eighty-five*") is an 8-bit microprocessor produced by Intel and introduced in March 1976. It is software-binary compatible with the more-famous [Intel 8080](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080/) with only two minor instructions added to support its added interrupt and serial input/output features. However, it requires less support circuitry, allowing simpler and less expensive microcomputer systems to be built. The "5" in the part number highlighted the fact that the 8085 uses a single +5-volt (V) power supply by using depletion-mode transistors, rather than requiring the +5 V, −5 V and +12 V supplies needed by the 8080. This capability matched that of the competing Z80, a popular 8080-derived CPU introduced the year before. These processors could be used in computers running the [CP/M operating system](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M/).
