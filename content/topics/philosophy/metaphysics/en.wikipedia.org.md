excerpt: >-
  **Metaphysics** is the branch of [philosophy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy/) that studies the fundamental nature of [reality](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality/). This includes the first principles of: being or existence, identity, change, space and time, cause and effect, necessity, actuality, and possibility.

    There *are* metaphysical problems, which cannot be disposed of by declaring them meaningless. For, as I have repeatedly said, they are "beyond physics" indeed and demand an act of faith. We have to accept this fact to be honest. There are two objectionable types of believers: those who believe the incredible and those who believe that "belief" must be discarded and replaced by "the scientific method."
