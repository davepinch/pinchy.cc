excerpt: >-
  The **Peripatetic school** (Ancient Greek: Περίπατος lit. 'walkway') was a philosophical school founded in 335 BC by [Aristotle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle/) in the Lyceum in Ancient Athens. It was an informal institution whose members conducted philosophical and scientific inquiries. After the middle of the 3rd century BC, the school fell into decline, and it was not until the Roman Empire that there was a revival.
