excerpt: >-
  The **dream argument** is the postulation that the act of dreaming provides preliminary evidence that the senses we trust to distinguish [reality](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality) from illusion should not be fully trusted, and therefore, any state that is dependent on our senses should at the very least be carefully examined and rigorously tested to determine whether it is in fact reality.
