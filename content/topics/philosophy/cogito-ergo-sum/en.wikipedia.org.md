  The Latin ***cogito, ergo sum***, usually translated into English as "**I think, therefore I am**", is the "first principle" of René Descartes's philosophy. He originally published it in French as *je pense, donc je suis* in his 1637 Discourse on the Method, so as to reach a wider audience than Latin would have allowed. It later appeared in Latin in his *Principles of Philosophy*, and a similar phrase also featured prominently in his *Meditations on First Philosophy*. The dictum is also sometimes referred to as **the cogito**. As Descartes explained in a margin note, "we cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt." In the posthumously published *The Search for Truth by Natural Light*, he expressed this insight as *dubito, ergo sum, vel, quod idem est, cogito, ergo sum* ("I doubt, therefore I am — or what is the same — I think, therefore I am"). Antoine Léonard Thomas, in a 1765 essay in honor of Descartes presented it as dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum ("I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am").
