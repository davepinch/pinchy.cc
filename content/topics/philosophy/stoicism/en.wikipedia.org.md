excerpt: >-
  **Stoicism** is a school of Hellenistic philosophy that flourished in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. The Stoics believed that the practice of virtue is enough to achieve eudaimonia: a well-lived, flourishing life. The Stoics identified the path to achieving it with a life spent practicing certain virtues in everyday life such as courage or temperance and living in accordance with nature. It was founded in the ancient Agora of Athens by [Zeno of Citium](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium/) around 300 BC.
