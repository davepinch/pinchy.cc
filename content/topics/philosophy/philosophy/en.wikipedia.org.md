**Philosophy** (*love of wisdom* in ancient Greek) is a systematic study of general and fundamental questions concerning topics like [existence](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence), reason, knowledge, value, mind, and language. It is a rational and critical inquiry that reflects on its own methods and assumptions.
