Astounding - create patterns with 64 sliders using an expression that defines the position of each slider. This URL opens a complex expression that allows you to navigate a Doom-like level. Use the arrows on your keyboard to move around, then click the blue button to see other example expressinos. You can edit any expression or create your own, which is a lot of fun.
