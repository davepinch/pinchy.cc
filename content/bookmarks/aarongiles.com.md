  I am a freelance Seattle-area pro­gram­mer, mu­si­cian, web de­vel­o­per, and gra­phic de­sign­er. {{<pilcrow>}} I have at various times worked for Microsoft, Connectix, LucasArts, and have a long history of creating free software and other stuff. See my programming page for detailed work history. {{<pilcrow>}} I am also an active musician, singing in several local groups and tinkering with the lute. See my music page for more details on what I’m up to musically.
