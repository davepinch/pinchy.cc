excerpt: >-
  Each type of animal on Earth has evolved a range of senses and skills which allow it to live successfully in its environment. Many of these adaptations are very different from how humans have evolved, and compared to humans some of these adaptations feel like they belong in a superhero comic. Senses such as ultraviolet vision, extra color receptors, and echolocation are very hard for humans to imagine, yet are part of the everyday life of hundreds of species of animals.
