excerpt: >-
  The Illusions Index is a fully searchable, interactive curated collection of illusions. The illusions are categorised into different types, allowing you to search for, and compare, illusions that fall under one or more type. Staff and students at the Centre for the Study of Perceptual Experience have researched each illusion to provide detailed information about what it teaches us about the philosophy and psychology of perception.
