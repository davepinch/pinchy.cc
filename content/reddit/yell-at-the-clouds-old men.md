  This is why I think screaming at God is the most logically sound way to scream at anyone. If there is no god, no loss. If there is, he should forgive you and understand, and the guilt from screaming at him will make you more humble. If he isn't forgiving, then he deserves to be screamed at. Win win win. Yell at the clouds, old men, for they are the only ones left who will listen.
