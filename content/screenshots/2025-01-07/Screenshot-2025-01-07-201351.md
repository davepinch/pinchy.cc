  A screenshot of Visual Studio Code showing a few warnings from the collation script. I recently added a requirement that pages tagged with [landform](/landform/) must have Wikidata and Wikipedia links. The page tributary.md is open and I have added a Wikidata link as required. VSCode is currently on the Source Control tab, showing that the following files have pending changes: collate.ps1, boomers.txt, tributary.md, lookup.json, pages.json, props.json.

  In the background I am watching *The Alternative Factor*, an episode of *Star Trek: The Original Series*.
