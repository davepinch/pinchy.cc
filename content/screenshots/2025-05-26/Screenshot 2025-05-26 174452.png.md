  Four days later the script was still running. However, I canceled the script once I started seeing messages that the server was overloaded. It is not my desire to abuse the Internet Archive. I insert a delay betweet calls (one reason the script takes so long), and I skip pages that have been archived within the last month. The script had queued a total of 25347 links, with 558 links remaining - so very close to completing. I will make some minor adjustments and re-start the script in the near future. 
ideas for future versions:
  - Enable the operator to turn sound on/off. I like the sounds, but in some cases they need to be turned off. It would be good if this was possible while the script is running. It is overkill to force the entire speaker to be turned off when sounds are inconvenient.
  - Enable the operator to specify the root site as a parameter. Eventually the script can be distributed as a separate utility, in which case it needs to be parameterized.
  - Enable the operator to specify a list of sites in a text file.
  - Enable the operator to specify patterns for sites to be skipped.
