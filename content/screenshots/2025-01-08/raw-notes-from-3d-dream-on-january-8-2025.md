title: "Raw notes from 3D dream on January 8, 2025"
description: >-
  This is a screenshot of the raw notes after a very lucid dream I had on January 8, 2025. I was seeing imagery of burning metal, constantly morphing and flairing. There were hexagon chunks of the metal. I recall realizing that I was lucid and being able to calm the rise of emotions from that awareness.
dream of: hexagon
