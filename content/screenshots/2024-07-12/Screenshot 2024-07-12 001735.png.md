  This picture is a screenshot of Visual Studio Code ("VSCode") set to maximum size on Windows 11. The clock reads 12:04 AM on 7/12/2024. The main panel of VSCode shows a portion of "collate.ps1", a PowerShell script that examines each markdown file. The script has been modified but not yet committed to the repository. It checks a variable named $foundProblems. If true, it writes "Problems found." and provides a tip to "ctrl+click the file path to open". The terminal panel shows the output of the script. There are four yellow warnings, each stating "No end of YAML front matter" followed by a path to a file. The files are "tonya-pearson-yoder/2019-11-20.md", "pauli-exclusion-principle.md", "stillaguamish-river.md", and "the-social-contract.md". The terminal window shows "Problems found." with a red background in stark constract to the black terminal window. The left panel of VSCode shows the contents of the "works" folder. The visible folders are named "r", "s", "t", "up-against-the-wall-motherfucker", "v", "w", and "x".
