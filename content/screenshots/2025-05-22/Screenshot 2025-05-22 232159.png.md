echo of this moment years later of: Sunny reflection of a woman in sandals
at the moment: >-
  On the evening of May 22, 2025, I began running a script that walks through the website and submits each page to the Internet Archive. My intent is to run the script continuously to ensure that all pages (and page updates) are captured over time. The script is still running as I write this description on the morning of May 23. This is not the first version of the script, but it is the first version that I am attempting to run until completion.
