  This was the first time I successfully ran the archiver script from start to finish without interruption. The archiver script walks through the website and submits pages to the Internet Archive. It only archives pages that haven't been archived in the last 30 days (720 hours). This run took a few days, although I don't think the script ran when the laptop was asleep (in a future version I will measure the total execution time). In the background I am moving pictures to Wikimedia Commons, and I am working with ChatGPT to iterate on the future message.
