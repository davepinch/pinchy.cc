at the moment: >-
  Mary is watching an interview with Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran. The Hamas-Israel war is at top of her mind as innocent children are being killed. The Israeli response is becoming increasingly untenable. Student protests against Biden could impact the coming presidential election. Trump was convicted of a felony. I am struggling with work and stress. Earlier today I found it interesting to press against a wall and increase awareness of being present. I found some good websites and thought to capture the screenshots. I deleted screenshots 1 through 7 because I got interrupted while trying to capture all screenshots in a single minute (I wanted all screenshots to have the same time). Despite deleting them, OneDrive continued saving new screenshots with (8), (9), etc., as a suffix. I decided to keep the filenames even though the spaces will make the URLs look poor. Nevertheless my last screenshot rolled over to the next minute.
