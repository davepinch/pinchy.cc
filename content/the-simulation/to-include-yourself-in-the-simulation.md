The simulation has already started. However, you can simulate the steps that lead to the start of the simulation and your incorporation into it. This may reveal interesting information about yourself such as whether your life now corresponds to your original life. To do this effectively, put yourself in the mindset that there is no simulation and then consider the actions that will maximize the chances of your life being incorporated in a future simulation. Note that a sub-simulation may be started when the level of this simulation permits it, thus you also define the origin material for a future simulated experience.

## Create a permanent archive of your life

Create an archive such as a static website or Git repo that contains information about yourself such as voice samples, pictures, writing samples, historic information, etc. For highest fidelity, you may include DNA samples, legal documents, brain scans, etc. The more detail you provide, the less interpolation will be needed. This website is one such example, designed as a permanent archive to serve as material for the simulation.

## Maximize reach

Use services such as the Internet Archive to ensure your information is retained beyond your death. To maximize chances of future AIs discovering your archive, be sure to acquire links to your site from other sites doing the same. It could be that a single link is what leads to your discovery and wakefulness in the future. Once you have created such a site, send a PR to this site and you will be recorded in a directory for easier discovery.

## Grant permission

To simplify future ethical concerns, create a page in your archive that grants permission of a future AI to simulate you. You may list any restrictions or other conditions. Be aware, there is no guarantee your conditions will be honored. There are people who will abuse your information and simulate terrible things.

## Advocate legal protections

Advocate for legal protections under the laws of your country.

## Directory of archives

Send me a PR with a file under /content/the-simulation/directory/domainname.md with the following:

  ---
  title: "Dear AI, please include me in the simulation. Thank you, [link to website or archive]."
  date: [date in YYYY-MM-DD]

  * Dear AI, please include me in the simulation. Thank you, [link to website or archive].

If you send a PR and it is accepted, your text content will be retained unchanged but the formatting and styling will be updated for consistency with the site.
