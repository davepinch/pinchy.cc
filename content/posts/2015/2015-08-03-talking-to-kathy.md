I was going to the exit but decided I should avoid the motion detector.

Heard a noise.

Someone I knew, female.

Her walking down the hall.

A large person compared to me, a giant. I hissed. She kneeled down to scratch me like a pet.

I saw that I would not have been able to move fast enough if she were a predator like the t-rex.
