  A full-term pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks (280 days), but conception typically occurs about 38 weeks (266 days) before birth, since pregnancy is counted from the first day of the last menstrual period. \ If you were born on April 14, 1974, your conception date was likely around July 22, 1973. However, this could vary by a week or so depending on individual factors.
