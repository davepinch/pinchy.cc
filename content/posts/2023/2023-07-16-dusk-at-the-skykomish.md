We left around 5pm to explore the [Skymomish River](/skykomish-river/) near [Monroe](/monroe/). On arrival downtown we turned toward the river but I missed the turnoff to the park. We crossed a bridge and I began looking for an exit to turn around. I saw a sign for beach access and turned left (upstream) and then noticed a warning sign that the road was closed in about 6 miles. Mary said we should keep going for a while, so we did. She then discovered in irritation I had drank most of her coffee.

The road was very picturesque. Mary took numerous pictures as we drove along. Every house was beautiful especially with the background of tree covered hills. On our left was the river. Unfortunately the road did not have many locations to pull over. Eventually we entered an uphill drive with many trees and Mary commented the environment was like a rainforest, "You can smell it". Eventually we reached the end of the road. A large sign blocked traffic, so we turned around.

We both needed to use the bathroom so we hurred back to town and looked for a suitable coffee house or restaurant. Mary saw a woman holding a boba tea so we figured a place was nearby. We parked and walked to a Thai restaurant that seemed good. Unfortunately service was extremely slow and we left after 20 minutes or so without service. We decided to visit [Al Borlin Park](/al-borlin-park/). The drive was interesting because it meandered around some apartments and interesting industrial sites. We reached the entrence and took a road to the river. The park had a bit of dark vibe due and seemed to have a few people up to no good.

To be finished...
