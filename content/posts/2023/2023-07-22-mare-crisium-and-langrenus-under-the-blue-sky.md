I stepped outside around lunchtime and saw the [Moon](/moon/) against a blue sky. I grabbed the 10x50 binoculars for my first observation of the Moon since childhood. Immediately prominent was the dark splotch of [Mare Crisium](/mare-crisium/) and the bright crater of [Langrenus](/langrenus/), both identified later.
