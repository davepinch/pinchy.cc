I saw [Giausar](/giausar/) and shouted to Mary. A few weeks ago we saw the star while tracing the path from the Big Dipper to [Polaris](/polaris/). We were curious about this star but it has not been visible for several days now. Giausar was faint so we started with [Megrez](/megrez/) to give some time for our eyes to adapt. Mary saw Giausar right way.
