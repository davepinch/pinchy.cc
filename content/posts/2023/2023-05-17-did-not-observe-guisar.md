[Giausar](/giausar/) at magnitude +3.85 was not visible with the naked eye tonight. The sky was clear but affected by light or dust. I could detect the star with a long exposure on my phone camera, which despite distortion showed its yellow color. For comparison, [Polaris](/polaris/) was visible with the naked eye but not prominent.
