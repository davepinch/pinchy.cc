title: "Watched The Running Man for the first time since childhood"
excerpt: >-
  Mary and I watched *The Running Man* film, which was the first time for her and the first time for me since childhood. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, yet I remember being snobby about the movie when I was younger. I read the original story and initially did not like the movie. But in the context of current events, the film is more enjoyable. I've read that a remake is in progress and I look forward to it.
