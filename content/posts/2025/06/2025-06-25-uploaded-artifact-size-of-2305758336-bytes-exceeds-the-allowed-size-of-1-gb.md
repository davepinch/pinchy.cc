artifact size: 2,305,758,336 bytes
at the moment: Back in March I saw a warning that the website used 2,308,863,370 bytes, which exceeds the maximum of 1 GB. I started using Wikimedia Commons for most new images whenever possible, and I began moving some images over. Today I looked through the latest build and saw that I was using 2,305,758,336 bytes - a reduction of 3,105,034 bytes (about 3 megabytes). Clearly I have not been reducing size fast enough. Although I have moved images, I've also added images that cannot be hosted on Wikimedia due to copyright issues, e.g., Wikimedia does not permit fair use. I am making a stronger effort to move suitable images over, with the aim of getting under a gigabyte in size.
