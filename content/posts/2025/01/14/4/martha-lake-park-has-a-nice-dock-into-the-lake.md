title: "Martha Lake Park has a nice dock into the lake."
description of: Crow on a dock of Martha Lake Park
note: >-
  I've noticed that I am self-conscious around people. There were a few women walking slowly along the main pathway of the park. I waited for a few minutes until they were farther along. They walked slowly.
