title: "That night we watched Big Trouble in Little China."
first viewing since childhood of: Big Trouble in Little China
notes:
  - We selected this movie for our nightly movie session because we have been watching some 1980s action films with Arnold, e.g., Terminator 2, The Running Man, etc. I thought this movie would be close in spirit. The other option was Escape from New York.
