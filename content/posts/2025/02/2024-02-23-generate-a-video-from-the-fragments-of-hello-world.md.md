title: "Generate a video from the fragments of hello world."
explanation of: fragments of hello world
fragments of: hello world
notes: >-
  Currently the [hello world](/hello-world/) page links to a random fragment, and each fragment links to another random fragment. Yesterday I had the idea of creating a video of the sequence of fragments. The sequence is randomized each time the site is built. Today I put together a PowerShell script that creates a screenshot of each page and then assembles the screenshots into a video.
