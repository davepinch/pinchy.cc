title: "An x-ray source on sky-map.org"
at the moment:
  - Early morning April 27, 2025.
  - I was browsing sky-map.org, fascinated by the x-ray view.
  - I scrolled around, looking for bright x-ray sources.
  - I then switched to an optical view to see the object in light.
  - Each one revealed to be a galaxy.
  - But this one looks like a star.
  - What is this object?
