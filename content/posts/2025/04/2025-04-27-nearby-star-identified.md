title: "An x-ray source on sky-map.org: nearby center identified"
description: ?-
  sky-map.org provided the coordinates of the center of the picture in decimal format (11.363736062784346, 11.73699789501237). This center is visually close to the x-ray source and appears to be near a star. To convert to minutes and seconds format, I entered these coordinates into an RA/Declination converter at https://www.astrouw.edu.pl/~jskowron/ra-dec/. This converter provides a link to wikisky.org, where I could identify the constellation and nearby stars. The star closest to the x-ray source is USNOA2 0975-06707839.
