title: "Man in the backyard"

dream: >-
  Late night. I looked out the back window and saw a jacketed man standing on top of our shed. He was not moving. I turned off the lights to avoid being seen but he disappeared. I went outside to investigate and discovered a key inserted into our side garage door, unlocked, and upon entering the garage woke up screaming. Later I dreamed I was a sniper and felt the distinct experience of it being wrong.
