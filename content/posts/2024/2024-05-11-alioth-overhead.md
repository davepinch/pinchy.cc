title: "Alioth overhead on May 11, 2024"
observation: >-
  On return from Lake Ballinger, the clear blue skies made me want to observe a few stars tonight. I stepped outside around 10PM and found the [Big Dipper](/big-dipper/) almost directly overhead, upside down from my familiar view. Mary was calling for the cat, who quickly ran to the door. I stepped back and startled Narda, who did not expect anyone to be outside.
