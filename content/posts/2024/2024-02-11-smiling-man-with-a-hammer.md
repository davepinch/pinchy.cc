title: "Smiling man with a hammer"

dream: >-
  We were sleeping in bed in a garage that had windows on its door. Mary thought someone was attempting to break in, but we could not see anyone in the dark shadows. There were homeless people outside. A few minutes later, Mary woke me up screaming that someone was breaking in. I looked up and a man casually walked into the room smiling, holding a hammer. I woke up screaming for real and Mary asked me about it the next morning.
