Nice unboxing experience.

However, my setup experience with Windows 11 was negative - I did not like the automatic remapping of my documents folder to OneDrive. I also did not like the distracting widget on the toolbar. In both cases turning them off was not intuitive.

Performance of this project in VSCode feels faster.
