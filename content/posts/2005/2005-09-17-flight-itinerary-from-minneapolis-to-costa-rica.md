I don't have many records of this trip. I found one email from Hotwire containing an itinerary. Upon return I remember having to race through Miami International Airport, and I remember being angry at customs agents in Minneapolis because they refused to allow any women to take care of sanitary needs (periods). They preferred women to bleed through their pants.
