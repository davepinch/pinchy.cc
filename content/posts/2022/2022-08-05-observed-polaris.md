I observed [Polaris](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris) this evening. Mary and I are in the garage making tie-die shirts. The latest measurement puts the distance of Polaris at 447.6 light years, or around year 1575 at the time of this writing. However, at the time Polaris was receiving light from an earlier [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth). That light would not have travelled 447.6 light years from Earth because both stars are moving.
