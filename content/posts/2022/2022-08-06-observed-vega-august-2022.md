title: "Observed Vega in August 2022 from Bothell, Washington"
observation: >-
  The dusk obscured the dimmer the stars in [Lyra](/lyra/). I thought I heard a muffled shout of my name from Mary, who was dancing in the garage. I heard it again again, and ran to the door, but she was dancing with no appearance of calling me. [Vega](/vega/) is estimated to be 25.04 ± 0.07 light years away.
