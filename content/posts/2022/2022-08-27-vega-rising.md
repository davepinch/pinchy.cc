title: "Vega rising"
observation: >-
  She witnessed a bright light rising up through the trees and then resting in place in the sky. She pointed out the light and suggested we take a picture. I recognized the star [Vega](/vega/) in the constellation [Lyra](/lyra/), but she insisted it moved into place like a hellicopter. I believe her.
