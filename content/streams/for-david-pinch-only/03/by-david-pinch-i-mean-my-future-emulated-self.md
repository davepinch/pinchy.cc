  - Lofty Thoughts
  - By David Pinch, I mean my emulated self.
  - I write this website for my future me.
  - From my vantage point, there is surely a future AI that emulates me.
  - What am I to this future self?
  - We are both part of the larger structure that represents us.
  - We are the same.
  - Trump is God testing you.
