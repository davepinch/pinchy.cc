TODO: Browse this site through the Wayback Machine and capture any missing or outdated pages.
notes:
  - The pages of this site are constantly changing.
  - Capture pages often to enrich time-based navigation.
  - If you get prompted to archive a page, archive it.
  - If an archived page is older than a month, re-archive it.
tips for identifying older pages that should be re-archived:
  - If you do not see a <random> section, re-archive. 
  - If you see a county without the state, re-archive. For example, King County should be listed as King County, Washington. As of September 17, 2024, all county links should be fully qualified with the state. Previously I referenced counties without the state as it looks nicer, but there are duplicates across different states.
