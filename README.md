# Welcome

This is the content and Jekyll source code for my blog at https://pinchy.cc. My blog contains notes, snippets, photos, reminders, bookmarks -- anything of interest to me. I use a sequential format in which every intended to make it easy for me to find something. I am also experimenting with different ways to present information. It will be perpetually under construction.


## Credits

This blog started with the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes), which provided great scaffholding as I learned Jekyll. I have since removed the theme but I will forever be grateful to the author.
