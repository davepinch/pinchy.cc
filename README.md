# Welcome

This repo contains the content and source code for https://pinchy.cc.
I do not recommend cloning this blog (yet) as it contains many large files that I need to move to Wikimedia Commons first. My plan is to create a template, and I will start that if someone asks (otherwise it is not high priority at the moment).

## Licensing

Anything I create alone is CC BY-SA 4.0 (Creative Commons).
Anything I create with the assistance of AI is public domain, as it should be.

The website is hosted by GitHub Pages, an awesome benefit of GitHub.

This blog started with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme, which provided great scaffolding to learn Jekyll. Eventually I went "barebones" and removed the theme, but I will forever be greatful to the author.

In November 2023 I migrated to Hugo from Jekyll. Jekyll is an excellent static website generator but I moved to Hugo to take advantage of its Go templating. I will always have a soft spot for Jekyll as the first static website generator I learned.

In July 2024 I started using the powershell-yaml PowerShell module to collate (pre-process) data prior to rendering in Hugo. See https://github.com/cloudbase/powershell-yaml.
