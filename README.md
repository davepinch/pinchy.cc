## Credits

This blog started with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme, which provided great scaffolding to learn Jekyll. Eventually I went "barebones" and removed the theme, but I will forever be greatful to the author.

In November 2023 I migrated to Hugo from Jekyll. Jekyll is an excellent static website generator but I moved to Hugo to take advantage of its Go templating. I will always have a soft spot for Jekyll as the first static website generator I learned.
