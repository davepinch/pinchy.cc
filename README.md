# Welcome

This repo contains the content and Hugo source code for my blog at https://pinchy.cc. The blog contains cross-linked notes, snippets, photos, reminders, bookmarks -- anything of interest to me. I use the blog as extended memory.

## Credits

This blog started with the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes), which provided great scaffholding as I learned Jekyll. I have since removed the theme but I will forever be grateful to the author.

In November 2023 I migrated to Hugo from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll is an excellent static website generator but I moved to Hugo to take advantage of its Go templating. I will always have a soft spot for Jekyll as the first static website generator I learned.
