I had read about [one-point perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)) and experimented with this picture of a sunny hallway in Studio A of the Microsoft campus. A glass wall is opposite the windows.

![This looks like a hallway but it is an illusion. Half of the picture is a glass wall that reflects the other side.](/assets/images/2015/2015-09-10-reflections-in-the-studio-smaller.jpg)
