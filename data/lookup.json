    "The final painting, Old Age, is an image of death. The man has grown old; he has survived the trials of life. The waters have calmed, the river flows into the waters of eternity. The figurehead and hourglass are missing from the battered boat; the withered old voyager has reached the end of earthly time. In the distance, an angel descends from heaven, while the guardian angel hovers close, gesturing toward the other. The man is once again joyous with the knowledge that Faith has sustained him through this perilous life to the promise of Heaven. The landscape is practically gone, just a few rough rocks represent the edge of the earthly world, and dark water stretches onward.

By observing that practices which may seem absurd to one group can be accepted as truth by another, he learns not to rely solely on tradition or common consent when forming his beliefs. Instead, Descartes advocates for critical thinking and caution against accepting ideas simply because they are widespread or habitual.

    "Washington\u0027s death came more swiftly than expected. On his deathbed, out of fear of being entombed alive, he instructed his private secretary Tobias Lear to wait three days before his burial. According to Lear, Washington died between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. on December 14, 1799, with Martha seated at the foot of his bed. His last words were \"\u0027Tis well\", from his conversation with Lear about his burial. He was 67.":  9924,
