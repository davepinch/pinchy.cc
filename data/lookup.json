The man is once again joyous with the knowledge that Faith has sustained him through this perilous life to the promise of Heaven. The landscape is practically gone, just a few rough rocks represent the edge of the earthly world, and dark water stretches onward.

I at once set off to their assistance with what men could be spared from the station ; we found they had saved nothing but their clothing, a cask of bread, and three boats; the few remaining fragments of the wreck were fast disappearing in the distance, being carried away by the moviug pack. The crew all safely reached the land that night, being ferried across the open leads by the boats from the. station; tents where pitched to shelter them, and every care given to their comfort":  20277,
