Unlike apparent magnitude, which measures how bright an object appears from Earth, absolute magnitude eliminates the effect of distance, allowing astronomers to compare the true luminosities of objects. A lower absolute magnitude indicates a brighter object, while a higher number signifies a dimmer one.

Storm clouds ominously darken the sky, wind whips at the man\u0027s clothing and rain falls in the background as the boat approaches a treacherous part of the river which has become rocky and rapid, running through a treacherous gorge marked by a gnarled, leafless tree. Gentler country lies at the bottom of the defile and the distant sky line lightens in that direction hinting of the hope of better times ahead. Among the dangers the man has not lost his faith: he has let go of his boat\u0027s tiller (which may have broken) and is part kneeling, gazing upward with hands clasped together. The vessel\u0027s figurehead now holds the hourglass while far above, behind and unseen by the voyager, his guardian angel continues to watch over from the Heavens, shining brightly through a break in the clouds.":  17153,

    "Vice President Cheney has been the most dangerous vice president we\u0027ve had probably in American history. The idea he doesn\u0027t realize that Article I of the Constitution defines the role of the vice president of the United States, that\u0027s the Executive Branch. He works in the Executive Branch. He should understand that. Everyone should understand that. And the primary role of the vice president of the United States of America is to support the president of the United States of America, give that president his or her best judgment when sought, and as vice president, to preside over the Senate, only in a time when in fact there\u0027s a tie vote. The Constitution is explicit. The only authority the vice president has from the legislative standpoint is the vote, only when there is a tie vote. He has no authority relative to the Congress.":  9257,
