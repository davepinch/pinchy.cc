    "[ChatGPT-40 mini] In this passage, Ren√© Descartes is addressing the idea that the truth of a matter is not necessarily determined by the number of people who agree on it. He suggests that when discovering complex or difficult truths, it is often more likely that a single individual will uncover the truth rather than a group. Descartes is emphasizing that the consensus of many does not automatically equate to truth, especially in challenging cases where individual insight and reasoning might be more effective in arriving at the truth.
