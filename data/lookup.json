    "The final painting, Old Age, is an image of death. The man has grown old; he has survived the trials of life. The waters have calmed, the river flows into the waters of eternity. The figurehead and hourglass are missing from the battered boat; the withered old voyager has reached the end of earthly time. In the distance, an angel descends from heaven, while the guardian angel hovers close, gesturing toward the other. The man is once again joyous with the knowledge that Faith has sustained him through this perilous life to the promise of Heaven. The landscape is practically gone, just a few rough rocks represent the edge of the earthly world, and dark water stretches onward.

He suggests that when discovering complex or difficult truths, it is often more likely that a single individual will uncover the truth rather than a group. Descartes is emphasizing that the consensus of many does not automatically equate to truth, especially in challenging cases where individual insight and reasoning might be more effective in arriving at the truth.
