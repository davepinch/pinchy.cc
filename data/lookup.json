    "The final painting, Old Age, is an image of death. The man has grown old; he has survived the trials of life. The waters have calmed, the river flows into the waters of eternity. The figurehead and hourglass are missing from the battered boat; the withered old voyager has reached the end of earthly time. In the distance, an angel descends from heaven, while the guardian angel hovers close, gesturing toward the other. The man is once again joyous with the knowledge that Faith has sustained him through this perilous life to the promise of Heaven. The landscape is practically gone, just a few rough rocks represent the edge of the earthly world, and dark water stretches onward.

When the vulnerability of, or threat to, specific classified information was exceptional, and the normal criteria for determining eligibility for access to classified information were insufficient to protect the information from unauthorized disclosure, the United States could establish Special Access Programs (‚ÄúSAPs‚Äù) to further protect the classified information. The number of these programs was to be kept to an absolute minimum and limited to programs in which the number of persons who ordinarily would have access would be reasonably small and commensurate with the objective of providing enhanced protection for the information involved. Only individuals with the appropriate security clearance and additional SAP permissions were authorized to have access to such national security information, which was subject to enhanced handling and storage requirements.":  16543,

    "Absolute magnitude is a measure of the intrinsic brightness of a celestial object, such as a star, galaxy, or asteroid, as it would appear if observed from a standard distance of 10 parsecs (about 32.6 light-years). Unlike apparent magnitude, which measures how bright an object appears from Earth, absolute magnitude eliminates the effect of distance, allowing astronomers to compare the true luminosities of objects. A lower absolute magnitude indicates a brighter object, while a higher number signifies a dimmer one.
