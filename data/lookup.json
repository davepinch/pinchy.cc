    "I am thrilled to announce Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as The United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). For too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health. The Safety and Health of all Americans is the most important role of any Administration, and HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming Health Crisis in this Country. Mr. Kennedy will restore these Agencies to the traditions of Gold Standard Scientific Research, and beacons of Transparency, to end the Chronic Disease epidemic, and to Make America Great and Healthy Again!":  8056,

Unlike apparent magnitude, which measures how bright an object appears from Earth, absolute magnitude eliminates the effect of distance, allowing astronomers to compare the true luminosities of objects. A lower absolute magnitude indicates a brighter object, while a higher number signifies a dimmer one. It provides a way to understand the actual energy output of stars and other celestial bodies.":  3903,
