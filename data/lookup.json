    "The final painting, Old Age, is an image of death. The man has grown old; he has survived the trials of life. The waters have calmed, the river flows into the waters of eternity. The figurehead and hourglass are missing from the battered boat; the withered old voyager has reached the end of earthly time. In the distance, an angel descends from heaven, while the guardian angel hovers close, gesturing toward the other. The man is once again joyous with the knowledge that Faith has sustained him through this perilous life to the promise of Heaven. The landscape is practically gone, just a few rough rocks represent the edge of the earthly world, and dark water stretches onward. Cole describes the scene: \"The chains of corporeal existence are falling away; and already the mind has glimpses of Immortal Life.\"":  18255,

    "In this passage from Discourse on the Method, Descartes emphasizes the importance of questioning commonly accepted beliefs and customs. By observing that practices which may seem absurd to one group can be accepted as truth by another, he learns not to rely solely on tradition or common consent when forming his beliefs. Instead, Descartes advocates for critical thinking and caution against accepting ideas simply because they are widespread or habitual. This approach allows him to gradually free himself from errors that can obscure our natural intelligence and hinder our ability to reason effectively.":  17877,

I at once set off to their assistance with what men could be spared from the station ; we found they had saved nothing but their clothing, a cask of bread, and three boats; the few remaining fragments of the wreck were fast disappearing in the distance, being carried away by the moviug pack. The crew all safely reached the land that night, being ferried across the open leads by the boats from the. station; tents where pitched to shelter them, and every care given to their comfort":  17807,

He suggests that when discovering complex or difficult truths, it is often more likely that a single individual will uncover the truth rather than a group. Descartes is emphasizing that the consensus of many does not automatically equate to truth, especially in challenging cases where individual insight and reasoning might be more effective in arriving at the truth.

Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a man. Between a man and a butterfly there is necessarily a distinction.
