**Dendrites** (from Greek δένδρον *déndron*, "[tree]({% include cc-url for="Tree - Wikipedia" %})"), also dendrons, are branched protoplasmic extensions of a nerve cell that propagate the electrochemical stimulation received from other neural cells to the cell body, or soma, of the [neuron]({% include cc-url for="Neuron - Wikipedia" %}) from which the dendrites project. Electrical stimulation is transmitted onto dendrites by upstream neurons (usually via their axons) via [synapses]({% include cc-url for="Synapse - Wikipedia" %}) which are located at various points throughout the dendritic tree. Dendrites play a critical role in integrating these synaptic inputs and in determining the extent to which action potentials are produced by the neuron.
