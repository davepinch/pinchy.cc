**Psilocybe cubensis** is a species of psilocybin mushroom of moderate potency whose principal active compounds are [psilocybin](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin) and [psilocin](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocin). Commonly called shrooms, magic mushrooms, golden halos, cubes, or gold caps, it belongs to the fungus family Hymenogastraceae and was previously known as Stropharia cubensis. It is the best-known psilocybin mushroom due to its wide distribution and ease of cultivation. This mushroom being optimal for home cultivation specifically, as was suggested in the 1970s, is primarily what led to cubensis being the psilocybin mushroom species most common on the black market as a street drug.
