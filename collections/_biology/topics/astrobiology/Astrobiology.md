**Astrobiology** is a scientific field within the life and environmental sciences that studies the origins, early evolution, distribution, and future of [life](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life) in the [universe](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe) by investigating its deterministic conditions and contingent events. As a discipline, astrobiology is founded on the premise that life may exist beyond Earth.
