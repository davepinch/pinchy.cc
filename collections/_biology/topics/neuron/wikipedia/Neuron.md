Within a [nervous system]({% include cc-url for="Nervous system - Wikipedia" %}), a **neuron**, **neurone**, or **nerve cell** is an electrically excitable cell that fires electric signals called action potentials. Neurons communicate with other cells via synapses - specialized connections that commonly use minute amounts of chemical neurotransmitters to pass the electric signal from the presynaptic neuron to the target cell through the synaptic gap. The neuron is the main component of nervous tissue in all animals except sponges and placozoa. Non-animals like plants and [fungi]({% include cc-url for="Fungus - Wikipedia" %}) do not have nerve cells.
