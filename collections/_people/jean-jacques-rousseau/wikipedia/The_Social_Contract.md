***The Social Contract***, originally published as ***On the Social Contract; or, Principles of Political Right*** (French: *Du contrat social; ou, Principes du droit politique*), is a 1762 French-language book by the Genevan philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The book theorizes about the best way to establish a political community in the face of the problems of commercial society, which Rousseau had already identified in his *Discourse on Inequality* (1755).
