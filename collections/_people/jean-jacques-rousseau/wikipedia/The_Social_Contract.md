***The Social Contract***, originally published as ***On the Social Contract; or, Principles of Political Right*** (French: *Du contrat social; ou, Principes du droit politique*), is a 1762 French-language book by the Genevan philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The book theorizes about the best way to establish a political community in the face of the problems of commercial society, which Rousseau had already identified in his *Discourse on Inequality* (1755).

*The Social Contract* helped inspire political reforms or revolutions in Europe, especially in France. *The Social Contract* argued against the idea that monarchs were divinely empowered to legislate. Rousseau asserts that only the people, who are sovereign, have that all-powerful right.
