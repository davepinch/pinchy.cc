**Timothy Francis Leary** (October 22, 1920 â€“ May 31, 1996) was an American psychologist and author known for his strong advocacy of psychedelic drugs. Evaluations of Leary are polarized, ranging from bold oracle to publicity hound. He was "a hero of American consciousness", according to Allen Ginsberg, and [Tom Robbins]({% include cc-url for="Tom Robbins - Wikipedia" %}) called him a "brave neuronaut".
