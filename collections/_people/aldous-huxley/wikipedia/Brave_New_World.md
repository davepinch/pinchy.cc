***Brave New World*** is a dystopian novel by English author [Aldous Huxley]({% include cc-url for="Aldous Huxley - Wikipedia" %}), written in 1931 and published in 1932. Largely set in a futuristic World State, whose citizens are environmentally engineered into an intelligence-based social hierarchy, the novel anticipates huge scientific advancements in reproductive technology, sleep-learning, psychological manipulation and classical conditioning that are combined to make a dystopian society which is challenged by the story's protagonist. Huxley followed this book with a reassessment in essay form, Brave New World Revisited (1958), and with his final novel, Island (1962), the utopian counterpart. This novel is often compared to [George Orwell]({% include cc-url for="George Orwell - Wikipedia" %})'s [Nineteen Eighty-Four]({% include cc-url for="Nineteen Eighty-Four - Wikipedia" %}) (1949).
