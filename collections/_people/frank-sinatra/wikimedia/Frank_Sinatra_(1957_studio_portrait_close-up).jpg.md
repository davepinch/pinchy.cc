Frank Sinatra in Capitol Studios, circa October 1957, during the recording of Come Fly with Me. A cropped version of the photograph was published on page 15 of the November 28, 1957, issue of the jazz magazine DownBeat (Vol. 24, No. 24). The accompanying story, titled "Sinatra: He's Frank" and written by John Tynan, detailed the entertainer's preparations before the premiere of the second Frank Sinatra Show (1957–58) on ABC. In 1959, United Artists distributed the photograph as a "keybook" publicity photo.
