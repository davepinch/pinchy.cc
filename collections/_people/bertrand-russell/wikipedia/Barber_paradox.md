The **barber paradox** is a puzzle derived from Russell's paradox. It was used by [Bertrand Russell]({% include cc-url for="Bertrand Russell - Wikipedia" -%}) as an illustration of the paradox, though he attributes it to an unnamed person who suggested it to him. The puzzle shows that an apparently plausible scenario is logically impossible. Specifically, it describes a barber who is defined such that he both shaves himself and does not shave himself, which implies that no such barber exists.
