**Samuel Langhorne Clemens** (November 30, 1835 â€“ April 21, 1910), best known by his pen name Mark Twain, was an American writer, humorist, entrepreneur, publisher, and lecturer. He was praised as the "greatest humorist the United States has produced", and William Faulkner called him "the father of American literature". His novels include *The Adventures of Tom Sawyer* (1876) and its sequel, *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* (1884), the latter of which has often been called the "Great American Novel". Twain also wrote *A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court* (1889) and *Pudd'nhead Wilson* (1894), and co-wrote *The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today* (1873) with Charles Dudley Warner.
