***The Mysterious Stranger*** is a novel attempted by the American author [Mark Twain]({% include cc-url for="Mark Twain - Wikipedia" %}). He worked on it intermittently from 1897 through 1908. Twain wrote multiple versions of the story; each involves a supernatural character called "Satan" or "No. 44". All the versions remained unfinished (with the exception of the last one, *No. 44, the Mysterious Stranger*).
