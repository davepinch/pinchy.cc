**Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky** (/tʃaɪˈkɒfski/ chy-KOF-skee; 7 May 1840 – 6 November 1893) was a Russian composer of the Romantic period. He was the first Russian composer whose music would make a lasting impression internationally. Tchaikovsky wrote some of the most popular concert and theatrical music in the current classical repertoire, including the ballets *Swan Lake* and *The Nutcracker*, the *1812 Overture*, his First Piano Concerto, Violin Concerto, the *Romeo and Juliet Overture-Fantasy*, several symphonies, and the opera *Eugene Onegin*.
