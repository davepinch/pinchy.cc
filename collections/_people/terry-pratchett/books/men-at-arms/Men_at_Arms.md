***Men at Arms*** is a fantasy novel by British writer [Terry Pratchett](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett), the 15th book in the *[Discworld](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld)* series, first published in 1993. It is the second novel about the Ankh-Morpork City Watch on the Discworld. Lance-constable Angua von Ãœberwald, later in the series promoted to the rank of Sergeant, is introduced in this book. Lance-constable (in the course of the novel promoted to Acting-constable) Detritus is introduced as a new member of the watch as well, though he had already appeared in other Discworld novels, most notably in *Moving Pictures*. Also notable is the only appearance of Lance-constable Cuddy (also promoted to Acting-constable).
