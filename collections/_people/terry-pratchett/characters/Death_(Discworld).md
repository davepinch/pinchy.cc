**Death** is a fictional character in [Terry Pratchett]({% include cc-url for="Terry Pratchett - Wikipedia" %})'s *[Discworld]({% include cc-url for="Discworld - Wikipedia" %})* series and a parody of several other personifications of death. Like most Grim Reapers, he is a black-robed skeleton who usually carries a scythe. His jurisdiction is specifically the Discworld itself; he is only a part, or minion, of Azrael: the universal Death. He has been generally used by Pratchett to explore the problems of human existence, and has become more sympathetic throughout the series.
