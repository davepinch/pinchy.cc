**"The Last Question"** is a [science fiction]({% include cc-url for="Science fiction - Wikipedia" %}) short story by American writer [Isaac Asimov]({% include cc-url for="Isaac Asimov - Wikipedia" %}). It first appeared in the November 1956 issue of *Science Fiction Quarterly* and was anthologized in the collections *Nine Tomorrows* (1959), *The Best of Isaac Asimov* (1973), *Robot Dreams* (1986), *The Best Science Fiction of Isaac Asimov* (1986), the retrospective *Opus 100* (1969), and in *Isaac Asimov: The Complete Stories, Vol. 1* (1990). While he also considered it one of his best works, “The Last Question” was Asimov's favorite short story of his own authorship, and is one of a loosely connected series of stories concerning a fictional computer called Multivac. Through successive generations, humanity questions Multivac on the subject of [entropy]({% include cc-url for="Entropy - Wikipedia" %}). The story overlaps science fiction, theology, and philosophy.
