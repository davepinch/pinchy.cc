**Kwon Do-Hyung** (Korean: 권도형), more commonly known as Do Kwon, is the South Korean co-founder and CEO of Singapore-based Terraform Labs, the parent company of crashed stablecoin TerraUSD and cryptocurrency Luna. TerraUSD and Luna collapsed in May 2022, wiping out almost $45 billion market capitalization in one week and causing hundreds of billions in losses in the larger crypto market. Kwon faces legal and social pressure regarding his role in the Terra crash. Various jurisdictions, including South Korea, Singapore, and the United States are taking legal action against Kwon.
