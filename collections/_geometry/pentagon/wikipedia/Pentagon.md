In geometry, a **pentagon** (from the Greek πέντε *pente* meaning *five* and γωνία *gonia* meaning *angle*) is any five-sided [polygon]({% include cc-url for="Polygon - Wikipedia" %}) or 5-gon. The sum of the internal angles in a simple pentagon is 540°.

A pentagon may be simple or self-intersecting. A self-intersecting *regular pentagon* (or *star pentagon*) is called a pentagram.
