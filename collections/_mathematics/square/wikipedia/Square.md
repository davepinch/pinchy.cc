In Euclidean [geometry](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry), a **square** is a regular [quadrilateral](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateral), which means that it has four equal sides and four equal angles (90-degree angles, π/2 radian angles, or right angles). It can also be defined as a rectangle with two equal-length adjacent sides. It is the only regular [polygon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon) whose internal angle, central angle, and external angle are all equal (90°), and whose diagonals are all equal in length. A square with vertices ABCD would be denoted ◻ ABCD.
