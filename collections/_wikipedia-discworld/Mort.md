***Mort*** is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett. Published in 1987, it is the fourth *Discworld* novel and the first to focus on the character Death, who only appeared as a side character in the previous novels. The title is the name of its main character, and is also a play on words: in French and Catalan, *mort* means "death". The French language edition is titled *Mortimer*, and the Catalan language edition is titled *Morth*.

In the BBC's 2003 Big Read contest, viewers voted on the "Nation's Best-loved Book"; *Mort* was among the Top 100 and chosen as the most popular of Pratchett's novels.

In 2004, Pratchett stated that *Mort* was the first Discworld novel with which he was "pleased", stating that in previous books, the plot had existed to support the jokes, but that in *Mort*, the plot was integral.
