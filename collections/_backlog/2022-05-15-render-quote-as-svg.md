*As a user, I can download a quote as an SVG file.*

## Notes

* This is a TODO: item for this blog. Feel free to send a PR to your project.
* Implement as a Jekyll plugin or include file and distribute as open source separately.
* The user should be able to right-click on the quote and download as a vector SVG file.
