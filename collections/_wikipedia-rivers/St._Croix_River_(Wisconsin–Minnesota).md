The **St. Croix River** (French: Holy Cross) is a tributary of the [Mississippi River]({% include cc-url for="Mississippi River - Wikipedia" %}), approximately 169 miles (272 km) long, in the U.S. states of [Wisconsin]({% include cc-url for="Wisconsin - Wikipedia" %}) and [Minnesota]({% include cc-url for="Minnesota - Wikipedia" %}). The lower 125 miles (201 km) of the river form the border between Wisconsin and Minnesota. The river is a National Scenic Riverway under the protection of the National Park Service. A hydroelectric plant at the Saint Croix Falls Dam supplies power to the Minneapolis–St. Paul metropolitan area.
