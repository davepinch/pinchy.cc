> Salaryman formed in 1996 when Rick Valentin, Rose Marshack, Jim Valentin and Howie Kantoff of indie rock stalwarts Poster Children traded in their guitars for synthesizers and began crafting a unique blend of instrumental electronic rock that owes as much to Booker T. and the M.G.'s as it does to Kraftwerk. After releasing three albums and touring throughout the United States and Europe at the turn of the new millennium, the band went into extended cryosleep, only recently re-emerging to once again provide a soundtrack for our increasingly digital world.
