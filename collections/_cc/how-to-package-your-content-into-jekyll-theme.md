Important: follow requirements and best practices in consideration of the community. For example, avoid polluting the bundle namespace with conversations.

## Open questions

* Should items be bundled into a custom collection?
* Or as data items?
* What naming conventions for the bundle should be followed?
* How to avoid polluting the bundle namespace?
* How to cross-reference other sites?
* How to cross-reference other bundles?

## Brainstorm

* Prefix bundle with metaj-?-theme (hints at Jekyll).

* Adding site name to version string, e.g., 1.0.0.pinchy.cc, 1.2.1.yoursitename. This causes the bundle to be considered prerelease (maybe not a bad idea) and gives a hint the package is for this purpose. Also consider a suffix like "cc".
