The **speed of light** in vacuum, commonly denoted ***c***, is a universal physical constant that is important in many areas of physics. The speed of light ***c*** is exactly equal to 299,792,458 metres per second (approximately 300,000 kilometres per second; 186,000 miles per second; 671 million miles per hour). According to the special theory of relativity, *c* is the upper limit for the speed at which conventional matter or energy (and thus any signal carrying information) can travel through space.
