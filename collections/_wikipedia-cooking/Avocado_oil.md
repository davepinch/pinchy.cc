**Avocado oil** is an edible oil extracted from the pulp of avocados, the fruit of *Persea americana*. It is used as an edible oil both raw and for cooking, where it is noted for its high smoke point. It is also used for lubrication and in cosmetics.

Avocado oil has an unusually high smoke point: 250 째C (482 째F) for unrefined oil and 271 째C (520 째F) for refined. The exact smoke point depends heavily on the quality of refinement and the way the oil is stored.
