**Ursa Minor** (Latin: 'Lesser Bear', contrasting with Ursa Major), also known as the **Little Bear**, is a constellation in the Northern Sky. As with the Great Bear, the tail of the Little Bear may also be seen as the handle of a ladle, hence the North American name, **Little Dipper**: seven stars with four in its bowl like its partner the Big Dipper. Ursa Minor was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Ursa Minor has traditionally been important for navigation, particularly by mariners, because of Polaris being the north pole star.
