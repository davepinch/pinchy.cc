**Ursa Major** (/ˈɜːrsə ˈmeɪdʒər/; also known as the **Great Bear**) is a constellation in the northern sky, whose associated mythology likely dates back into prehistory. Its Latin name means "greater (or larger) bear," referring to and contrasting it with nearby Ursa Minor, the lesser bear. In antiquity, it was one of the original 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD, drawing on earlier works by Greek, Egyptian, Babylonian, and Assyrian astronomers. Today it is the third largest of the 88 modern constellations.

Early mentions of Ursa Major can be found in Isidore of Seville's Etymologies(c. 560-636), specifically Book 3, held in Corpus Christi College. "Arcturus", the brightest star in the constellation of Boötes, was described as being "set behind the tail of the Great Bear". In astronomy, Isidore referred to the Great Bear constellation as a wagon due to its rotation like a wheel and called it Septentriones, "seven oxen", in other words Septentrional referring to the Big Dipper. Linguistically at the time there was little difference to the oxen, *sus*, and the bear, *ursus*. Needless to say, the Greeks and Romans at the time did not have much contact with bears due to bears being native further North. The origins of *ursus* (Latin) and *arktas* (Greek) are pronounced similarly and have the same Proto-Indo-European roots of the bear. Isidore documented folklore from word of mouth from travelers and philosophers. This is highly evident in his Bestiary, where he depicts "Draco", dragons, and Sirens as indisputable truth, and the likelihood that he has personally seen a bear in 560 AD needs to be considered. In his book, he describes the Greeks, who he refers to as pagans, as a source for depicting constellations as bears, crabs and numerous other animals that make up the Greek zodiac.

Ursa Major is primarily known from the asterism of its main seven stars, which has been called the "Big Dipper," "the Wagon," "Charles's Wain," or "the Plough," among other names. In particular, the Big Dipper's stellar configuration mimics the shape of the "Little Dipper." Two of its stars, named Dubhe and Merak (α Ursae Majoris and β Ursae Majoris), can be used as the navigational pointer towards the place of the current northern pole star, Polaris in Ursa Minor.

Ursa Major, along with asterisms that incorporate or comprise it, is significant to numerous world cultures, often as a symbol of the north. Its depiction on the flag of Alaska is a modern example of such symbolism.

Ursa Major is visible throughout the year from most of the northern hemisphere, and appears circumpolar above the mid-northern latitudes. From southern temperate latitudes, the main asterism is invisible, but the southern parts of the constellation can still be viewed.
