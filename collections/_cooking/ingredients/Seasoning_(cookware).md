**Seasoning** or **curing** is the process of coating the surface of cookware with a bioplastic formed from heated fat or oil in order to produce a heat, corrosion, and stick resistant hard coating. It is required for cast-iron cookware and carbon steel, which otherwise rust rapidly in use, but is also used for many other types of cookware, as it helps prevent food sticking.

Some cast-iron and carbon steel cookware is pre-seasoned by manufacturers, but most needs to be seasoned by the users. To form seasoning, the item is thoroughly cleaned, coated in a very thin layer of fat or oil, and then heated beyond the smoke point until the bioplastic layer forms. The surface may then be lightly polished, and further layers are commonly applied.

Stainless steel and aluminium cookware do not require protection from corrosion, but seasoning reduces sticking, and can help with browning as the seasoning coating has high thermal emissivity. Other cookware surfaces are generally not seasoned.

A seasoned surface is hydrophobic and highly attractive to oils and fats used for cooking. These form a layer that prevents foods, which typically contain water, from touching and cooking on to the hydrophilic metallic cooking surface underneath. These properties are useful when frying, roasting and baking.
