**Scutum** is a small constellation. Its name is Latin for shield, and it was originally named **Scutum Sobiescianum** by Johannes Hevelius in 1684. Located just south of the celestial equator, its four brightest stars form a narrow diamond shape. It is one of the 88 IAU designated constellations defined in 1922.
