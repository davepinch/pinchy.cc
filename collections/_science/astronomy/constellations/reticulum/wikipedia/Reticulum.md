**Reticulum** is a small, faint constellation in the [southern sky](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_celestial_hemisphere). Its name is Latin for a small net, or reticleâ€”a net of crosshairs at the focus of a telescope eyepiece that is used to measure star positions. The constellation is best viewed between October and December, and save for one main star visible in ideal conditions, cannot be seen from north of the 30th parallel north.
