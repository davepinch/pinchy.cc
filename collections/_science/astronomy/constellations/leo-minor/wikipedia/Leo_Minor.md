**Leo Minor** is a small and faint constellation in the northern celestial hemisphere. Its name is Latin for "the smaller lion", in contrast to [Leo](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_(constellation)), the larger lion. It lies between the larger and more recognizable [Ursa Major](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major) to the north and Leo to the south. Leo Minor was not regarded as a separate constellation by classical astronomers; it was designated by Johannes Hevelius in 1687.
