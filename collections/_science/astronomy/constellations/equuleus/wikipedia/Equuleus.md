**Equuleus** (/ɪˈkwuːliəs/ ih-KWOO-lee-əs) is a faint constellation located just north of the celestial equator. Its name is Latin for "little horse", a foal. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [Ptolemy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy), and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is the second smallest of the modern constellations (after [Crux](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crux)), spanning only 72 square degrees. It is also very faint, having no stars brighter than the fourth magnitude.
