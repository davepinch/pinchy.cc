**Hydra** is the largest of the 88 modern constellations, measuring 1303 square degrees, and also the longest at over 100 degrees. Its southern end borders [Libra](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libra_(constellation)) and [Centaurus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaurus) and its northern end borders [Cancer](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_(constellation)). It was included among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [Ptolemy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy). Commonly represented as a water snake, it straddles the celestial equator.
