**Lacerta** is one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union. Its name is Latin for lizard. A small, faint constellation, it was defined in 1687 by the astronomer Johannes Hevelius. Its brightest stars form a "W" shape similar to that of [Cassiopeia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_(constellation)), and it is thus sometimes referred to as 'Little Cassiopeia'. It is located between [Cygnus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_(constellation)), Cassiopeia and [Andromeda](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_(constellation)) on the northern celestial sphere. The northern part lies on the [Milky Way](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way).
