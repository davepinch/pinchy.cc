**Pyxis** is a small and faint constellation in the southern sky. Abbreviated from **Pyxis Nautica**, its name is Latin for a mariner's compass (contrasting with Circinus, which represents a draftsman's compasses). Pyxis was introduced by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille in the 18th century, and is counted among the 88 modern constellations.
