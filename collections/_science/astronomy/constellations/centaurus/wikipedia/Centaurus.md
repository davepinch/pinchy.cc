**Centaurus** /sɛnˈtɔːrəs, -ˈtɑːr-/ is a bright constellation in the southern sky. One of the largest constellations, Centaurus was included among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer [Ptolemy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy), and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. In Greek mythology, Centaurus represents a centaur; a creature that is half human, half horse (another constellation named after a centaur is one from the zodiac: [Sagittarius](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(constellation))). Notable stars include Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system to the [Solar System](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System), its neighbour in the sky Beta Centauri, and V766 Centauri, one of the largest stars yet discovered. The constellation also contains Omega Centauri, the brightest globular cluster as visible from [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) and the largest identified in the [Milky Way](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy), possibly a remnant of a dwarf galaxy.
