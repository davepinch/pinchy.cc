**Caelum** /ˈsiːləm/ is a faint constellation in the southern sky, introduced in the 1750s by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille and counted among the 88 modern constellations. Its name means “*chisel*” in Latin, and it was formerly known as Caelum Sculptorium (“*the engravers’ chisel*”); It is a rare word, unrelated to the far more common Latin *caelum*, meaning “sky, heaven, atmosphere”. It is the eighth-smallest constellation, and subtends a solid angle of around 0.038 steradians, just less than that of Corona Australis.
