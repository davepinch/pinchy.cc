**Mars** is the fourth planet and the furthest terrestrial planet from the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun). The reddish color of its surface is due to finely grained iron(III) oxide dust in the soil, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet". Mars’s radius is second smallest among the planets in the [Solar System](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System) at 3,389.5 km (2,106 mi). It has a surface gravity of 3.72 m/s2 (12.2 ft/s2), which is 38% of [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth)'s gravity. The Martian dichotomy is visible on the surface: on average, the terrain on Mars’s northern hemisphere is flatter and lower than its southern hemisphere. Mars has a thin atmosphere made primarily of carbon dioxide and two irregularly shaped natural satellites: Phobos and Deimos.
