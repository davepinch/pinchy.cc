The **southern celestial hemisphere**, also called the **Southern Sky**, is the southern half of the [celestial sphere](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_sphere); that is, it lies south of the celestial equator. This arbitrary sphere, on which seemingly fixed stars form constellations, appears to rotate westward around a polar axis due to Earth's rotation.
