The **Great Attractor** is a purported gravitational attraction in intergalactic space and the apparent central gravitational point of the [Laniakea Supercluster](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laniakea_Supercluster). This supercluster contains the [Milky Way](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way), as well as about 100,000 other galaxies.
