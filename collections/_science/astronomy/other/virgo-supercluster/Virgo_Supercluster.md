The **Virgo Supercluster** (**Virgo SC**) or the **Local Supercluster** (**LSC** or **LS**) is a mass concentration of galaxies containing the Virgo Cluster and Local Group, which itself contains the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies, as well as others. At least 100 galaxy groups and clusters are located within its diameter of 33 megaparsecs (110 million light-years). The Virgo SC is one of about 10 million superclusters in the observable universe and is in the Piscesâ€“Cetus Supercluster Complex, a galaxy filament.
