**Beta Ursae Minoris** (**β Ursae Minoris**, abbreviated **β UMi**, **Beta UMi**), formally named **Kochab** /ˈkoʊkæb/, is the brightest star in the bowl of the Little Dipper asterism (which is part of the constellation of [Ursa Minor]({% include cc-url for="Ursa Minor - Wikipedia" %})), and only slightly fainter than [Polaris]({% include cc-url for="Polaris - Wikipedia" %}), the northern pole star and brightest star in Ursa Minor. Kochab is 16 degrees from Polaris and has an apparent visual magnitude of 2.08. The distance to this star from the [Sun]({% include cc-url for="Sun - Wikipedia" %}) can be deduced from the parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission, yielding a value of 130.9 light-years (40.1 parsecs).
