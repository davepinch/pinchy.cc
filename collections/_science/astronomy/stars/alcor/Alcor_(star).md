**Alcor** (/ˈælkɔːr/) is a binary star system in the constellation of [Ursa Major](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major). It is the fainter companion of [Mizar](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizar), the two stars forming a naked eye double in the handle of the Big Dipper (or Plough) asterism in Ursa Major. The two both lie about 83 light-years away from the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun), as measured by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite.
