The **Andromeda Galaxy** is a barred spiral galaxy and is the nearest major galaxy to the [Milky Way](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way), where the [Solar System](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System) resides. It was originally named the **Andromeda Nebula** and is cataloged as **Messier 31**, **M31**, and **NGC 224**. Andromeda has a diameter of about 46.56 kiloparsecs (152,000 light-years) and is approximately 765 kpc (2.5 million light-years) from [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth). The galaxy's name stems from the area of Earth's sky in which it appears, the constellation of [Andromeda](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_(constellation)), which itself is named after the princess who was the wife of Perseus in Greek mythology.
