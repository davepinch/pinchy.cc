The **Chuckanut Formation** in northwestern [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)) (named after the [Chuckanut Mountains](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuckanut_Mountains), near [Bellingham](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellingham,_Washington)), its extension in southwestern [British Columbia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia) (the Huntingdon Formation), and various related formations in central Washington (including the Swauk, Roslyn, Manastash, and Chumstick) are fluvial sedimentary formations of [Eocene](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene) age, deposited from about 54 million years ago to around 34 million years ago. The nature of the deposits and included plant fossils indicate a low-lying coastal plain with a subtropical climate; the nature of the sediments indicates metamorphic sources in northeastern Washington.
