The **Chuckanut Mountains** (from "Chuckanut", an indigenous word meaning "long beach far from a narrow entrance"), or Chuckanuts, are located on the northern Washington state coast of the Salish Sea, just south of [Bellingham]([Bellingham](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellingham,_Washington))), [Washington]([Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state))). Being a part of the Cascade Range, they are the only place where the Cascades come west down to meet the sea. The Chuckanuts are considered to be a part of the Puget Lowland Forest Ecoregion.
