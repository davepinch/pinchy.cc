**Fungiculture** is the cultivation of [fungi](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus/) such as [mushrooms](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom). Cultivating fungi can yield foods (which include mostly mushrooms), medicine, construction materials and other products. A mushroom farm is involved in the business of growing fungi.
