A **dendrite** (from Greek δένδρον *déndron*, "[tree](/tree/)") or **dendron** is a branched protoplasmic extension of a nerve cell that propagates the electrochemical stimulation received from other neural cells to the cell body, or soma, of the [neuron](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron) from which the dendrites project. Electrical stimulation is transmitted onto dendrites by upstream neurons (usually via their [axons](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon)) via [synapses](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse) which are located at various points throughout the dendritic tree.
