***Acer macrophyllum***, the bigleaf maple or Oregon maple, is a large deciduous tree in the genus Acer.

It is native to western [North America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America), mostly near the Pacific coast, from southernmost [Alaska](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska) to southern [California](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California). Some stands are also found inland in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada of central California, and a tiny population occurs in central [Idaho](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho).
