***Ginkgo biloba***, commonly known as *ginkgo* or *gingko* (/ˈɡɪŋkoʊ, ˈɡɪŋkɡoʊ/ *GINK-oh*, *-⁠goh*), also known as the *maidenhair tree*, is a species of gymnosperm tree native to China. It is the last living species in the order Ginkgoales, which first appeared over 290 million years ago. Fossils very similar to the living species, belonging to the genus Ginkgo, extend back to the Middle Jurassic approximately 170 million years ago. The tree was cultivated early in human history and remains commonly planted.
