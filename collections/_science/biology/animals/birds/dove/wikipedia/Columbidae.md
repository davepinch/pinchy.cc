**Columbidae** (/kəˈlʌmbɪdiː/) is a bird family consisting of **doves** and **pigeons**. It is the only family in the order Columbiformes. These are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills that in some species feature fleshy ceres. They primarily feed on seeds, fruits, and plants. The family occurs worldwide, but the greatest variety is in the Indomalayan and Australasian realms.
