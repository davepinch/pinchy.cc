**Winter** is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate climates. It occurs after [autumn](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn) and before [spring](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(season)). The tilt of [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth)'s axis causes seasons; winter occurs when a hemisphere is oriented away from the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun). Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.
