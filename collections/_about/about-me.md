This blog is my *Commonplace Book*. It contains notes, snippets, photos, reminders, bookmarks -- anything of interest to me. It also serves as my extended memory as I get older.

* I like to find plant [species](/species/) in the [Pacific Northwest](/pacific-northwest/).
* I tend to like photographs with [interesting angles and light patterns](/favorite-photo/).
* I write [cues](/cue/) to prompt me to take action.
* I write down [random fragments](/fragment/) to see if they evolve into something.
