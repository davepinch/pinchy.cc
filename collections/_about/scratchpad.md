## Decision Matrix

* This matrix can help you choose an item from a list.
* First add a row for each item in the list.
* Then add a column for each factor that is important to you, e.g., low price, easy to use, etc.
* For each factor, rate its importance on a scale of 1 to 10. Higher numbers arae more important.

With the matrix now complete, you can begin rating each item in the list. For each item, you will consider each factor and rate the item on a scale of 1 to 10. For best results, when rating an item agaainst a factor, do not consider any other factors. Rate each factor independently.
