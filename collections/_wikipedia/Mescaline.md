**Mescaline** or **mescalin** (**3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine**) is a naturally occurring psychedelic protoalkaloid of the substituted phenethylamine class, known for its hallucinogenic effects comparable to those of LSD and psilocybin. It occurs naturally in the San Pedro cactus (*Echinopsis (syn. Trichocereus) pachanoi*), the Peruvian torch (*Echinopsis peruviana (syn. Trichocereus peruvianus)*), the Bolivian torch cactus (*Echinopsis lageniformis (syn. Trichocereus bridgesii)*), the *Echinopsis scopulicola*, the peyote cactus (*Lophophora williamsii*), and other species of cacti. It is also found in small amounts in certain members of the bean family, Fabaceae, including *Acacia berlandieri*. However those claims concerning Acacia species have been challenged and have been unsupported in any additional analysis.
