The **flat Earth** model is an archaic and scientifically disproven conception of Earth's shape as a plane or disk. Nevertheless, many ancient cultures subscribed to a flat Earth cosmography, including Greece until the classical period (323 BC), the Bronze and Iron Age civilizations of the Near East until the Hellenistic period (31 BC), and China until the 17th century.
