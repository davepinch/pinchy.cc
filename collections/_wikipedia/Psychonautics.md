**Psychonautics** (from the Ancient Greek ψυχή *psychē* 'soul, spirit, mind' and ναύτης *naútēs* 'sailor, navigator') refers both to a methodology for describing and explaining the subjective effects of altered states of consciousness, including those induced by meditation or mind-altering substances, and to a research cabal in which the researcher voluntarily immerses themselves into an altered mental state in order to explore the accompanying experiences.
