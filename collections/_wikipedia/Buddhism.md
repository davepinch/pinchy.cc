**Buddhism** (/ˈbʊdɪzəm/ *BUU-dih-zəm* or /ˈbuːd-/ *BOOD-*), also known as **Buddha Dharma** or **Dharmavinaya** (transl. "doctrines and disciplines"), is an Indian religion or philosophical tradition based on a series of original teachings that are attributed to Gautama Buddha (born Siddhārtha Gautama in the 5th century BCE). Originating in ancient India as a movement professing *śramaṇa* between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, it was gradually spread throughout much of Asia via the Silk Road. Presently, it is the world's fourth-largest religion, with over 520 million followers (**Buddhists**) who comprise seven percent of the global population. Buddhism encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs, and spiritual practices that are largely based on the Buddha's teachings and their resulting interpreted philosophies.
