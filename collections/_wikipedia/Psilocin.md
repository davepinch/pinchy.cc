**Psilocin** (also known as **4-HO-DMT**, **4-hydroxy DMT**, **psilocine**, **psilocyn**, or **psilotsin**) is a substituted tryptamine alkaloid and a serotonergic psychedelic substance. It is present in most psychedelic mushrooms together with its phosphorylated counterpart psilocybin. Psilocin is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The mind-altering effects of psilocin are highly variable and subjective and resemble those of LSD and DMT.
