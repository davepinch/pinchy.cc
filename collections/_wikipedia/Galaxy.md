A **galaxy** is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word is derived from the Greek *galaxias* (γαλαξίας), literally 'milky', a reference to the Milky Way galaxy that contains the Solar System. Galaxies, averaging an estimated 100 million stars, range in size from dwarfs with less than a hundred million (10^8) stars, to the largest galaxies known - supergiants with one hundred trillion (10^14) stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass.
