***Alhamdulillah*** (Arabic: ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّٰهِ, *al-Ḥamdu lillāh*) is an Arabic phrase meaning "praise be to God",[1] sometimes translated as "thank God". This phrase is called *Tahmid* (Arabic: تَحْمِيد, lit. 'Praising'). A longer variant of the phrase is *al-ḥamdu l-illāhi rabbi l-ʿālamīn* (ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّٰهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ), meaning "all praise is due to God, Lord of all the worlds", first verse of Surah Al-Fatiha.
