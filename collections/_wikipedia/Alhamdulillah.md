***Alhamdulillah*** (Arabic: ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّٰهِ, *al-Ḥamdu lillāh*) is an Arabic phrase meaning "praise be to God", sometimes translated as "thank God" This phrase is called ***Tahmid*** (Arabic: تَحْمِيد, lit. 'Praising') or **Hamdalah** (Arabic: حَمْدَلَة). A longer variant of the phrase is *al-ḥamdu l-illāhi rabbi l-ʿālamīn* (ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّٰهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ), meaning "all praise is due to God, Lord of all the worlds", first verse of Surah Fatihah.
