***Mort*** is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett. Published in 1987, it is the fourth *Discworld novel* and the first to focus on the character Death, who only appeared as a side character in the previous novels. The title is the name of its main character, and is also a play on words: in French and Catalan, *mort* means "death". The French language edition is titled *Mortimer*, and the Catalan language edition is titled *Morth*.
