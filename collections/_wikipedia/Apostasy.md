**Apostasy** (/əˈpɒstəsi/; Greek: ἀποστασία *apostasía*, 'a defection or revolt') is the formal disaffiliation from, abandonment of, or renunciation of a religion by a person. It can also be defined within the broader context of embracing an opinion that is contrary to one's previous religious beliefs. One who undertakes apostasy is known as an **apostate**. Undertaking apostasy is called **apostatizing** (or **apostasizing** – also spelled **apostacizing**). The term apostasy is used by sociologists to mean the renunciation and criticism of, or opposition to, a person's former religion, in a technical sense, with no pejorative connotation.
