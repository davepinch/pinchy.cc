A **psychoactive drug**, **psychopharmaceutical**, **psychoactive agent**, or **psychotropic drug**, is a chemical substance that changes functions of the nervous system and results in alterations in perception, mood, consciousness, cognition or behavior. These substances may be used medically, recreationally, or spiritually; to purposefully improve performance or alter one's consciousness; as entheogens for ritual, spiritual, or shamanic purposes, or for research. Some categories of psychoactive drugs, which have therapeutic value, are prescribed by physicians and other healthcare practitioners. Examples include anesthetics, analgesics, anticonvulsants, and antiparkinsonian drugs, as well as medications used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders, such as antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, and stimulant medications. Some psychoactive substances may be used in the detoxification and rehabilitation programs for persons dependent on or addicted to other psychoactive drugs.
