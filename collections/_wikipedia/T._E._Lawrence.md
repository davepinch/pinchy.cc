**Thomas Edward Lawrence** [**T. E. Lawrence**] (16 August 1888 – 19 May 1935) was a British archaeologist, army officer, diplomat, and writer who became famous for his role in the Arab Revolt and the Sinai and Palestine Campaign against the Ottoman Empire during the First World War, and was commonly referred to as **Lawrence of Arabia**. After widespread fame, to avoid recognition he adopted the alias T. E. Shaw.
