**Taoism** (/ˈtaʊɪzəm/, /ˈdaʊɪzəm/) or **Daoism** (/ˈdaʊɪzəm/) refers to either a school of philosophical thought (道家; daojia) or to a religion (道教; daojiao); both share ideas and concepts of Chinese origin and emphasize living in harmony with the *Tao* (Chinese: 道; pinyin: Dào; lit. 'Way', 'Thoroughfare'). The *Tao Te Ching*, a book containing teachings attributed to Laozi (老子), together with the later writings of Zhuangzi, are both widely considered the keystone works of Taoism.
