**Taoism** or **Daoism** (/ˈtaʊɪzəm/ or /ˈdaʊɪzəm/) refers to a set of Chinese traditions and religions which emphasize living in harmony with the Tao (Chinese: 道; pinyin: *Dào*; Wade–Giles: *Tao*; lit. 'Way', 'Path'). The *Tao* is generally defined as the source of everything and the ultimate principle underlying reality. The *Tao Te Ching* and the *Zhuangzi* are widely considered key Taoist texts.
