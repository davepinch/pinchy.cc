**Geology** (from Ancient Greek γῆ (*gê*) 'earth', and λoγία (*-logía*) 'study of, discourse') is a branch of natural science concerned with Earth and other astronomical objects, the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change over time. Modern geology significantly overlaps all other Earth sciences, including hydrology. It is integrated with Earth system science and planetary science.
