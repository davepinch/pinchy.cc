The **speed of light** in vacuum, commonly denoted ***c***, is a universal physical constant that is important in many areas of physics. Its exact value is defined as 299792458 metres per second (approximately 300000 km/s or 186000 mi/s). According to the special theory of relativity, *c* is the upper limit for the speed at which conventional matter, energy or any signal carrying information can travel through space.
