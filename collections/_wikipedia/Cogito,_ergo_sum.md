The Latin ***cogito, ergo sum***, usually translated into English as "**I think, therefore I am**", is the "first principle" of René Descartes's philosophy. He originally published it in French as *je pense, donc je suis* in his 1637 Discourse on the Method, so as to reach a wider audience than Latin would have allowed. It later appeared in Latin in his *Principles of Philosophy*, and a similar phrase also featured prominently in his *Meditations on First Philosophy*. The dictum is also sometimes referred to as **the cogito**. As Descartes explained in a margin note, "we cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt." In the posthumously published *The Search for Truth by Natural Light*, he expressed this insight as *dubito, ergo sum, vel, quod idem est, cogito, ergo sum* ("I doubt, therefore I am — or what is the same — I think, therefore I am"). Antoine Léonard Thomas, in a 1765 essay in honor of Descartes presented it as dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum ("I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am").

Descartes's statement became a fundamental element of Western philosophy, as it purported to provide a certain foundation for knowledge in the face of radical doubt. While other knowledge could be a figment of imagination, deception, or mistake, Descartes asserted that the very act of doubting one's own existence served—at minimum—as proof of the reality of one's own mind; there must be a thinking entity—in this case the self—for there to be a thought.

One critique of the dictum, first suggested by Pierre Gassendi, is that it presupposes that there is an "I" which must be doing the thinking. According to this line of criticism, the most that Descartes was entitled to say was that "thinking is occurring", not that "I am thinking".
