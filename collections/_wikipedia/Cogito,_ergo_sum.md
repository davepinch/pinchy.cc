The Latin ***cogito, ergo sum***, usually translated into English as "**I think, therefore I am**", is the "first principle" of René Descartes's philosophy. As Descartes explained in a margin note, "we cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt." Descartes's statement became a fundamental element of Western philosophy, as it purported to provide a certain foundation for knowledge in the face of radical doubt.
