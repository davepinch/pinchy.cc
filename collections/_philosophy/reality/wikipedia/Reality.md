**Reality** is the sum or aggregate of all that is real or existent within a system, as opposed to that which is only imaginary, nonexistent or nonactual. The term is also used to refer to the ontological status of things, indicating their [existence](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence). In physical terms, reality is the totality of a system, known and unknown.
