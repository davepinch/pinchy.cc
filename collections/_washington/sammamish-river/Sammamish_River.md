The **Sammamish River** (also known as **Sammamish Slough**) flows through north King County, Washington for about 14 miles (23 km), draining Lake Sammamish into Lake Washington. Along its course, the Sammamish River flows through Redmond, Woodinville, Bothell, and Kenmore.

The river is named after the native people who once lived along its entire length.
