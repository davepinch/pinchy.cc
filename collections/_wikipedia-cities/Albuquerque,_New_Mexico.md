**Albuquerque** (/ˈælbəˌkɜːrki/ *AL-bə-kur-kee*; Spanish: [alβuˈkeɾke]), abbreviated as ABQ, is the most populous city in the U.S. state of New Mexico. Its nicknames, *The Duke City* and *Burque*, both reference its 1706 founding by Nuevo México governor Francisco Cuervo y Valdés as *La Villa de Alburquerque*. Named in honor of the Viceroy of New Spain, the 10th Duke of Alburquerque, the city was an outpost on El Camino Real linking Mexico City to the northernmost territories of New Spain.
