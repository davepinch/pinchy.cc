**Albuquerque** (/ˈælbəkɜːrki/ *AL-bə-kur-kee*; Spanish: [alβuˈkeɾke]), abbreviated **ABQ**, is the most populous city in the U.S. state of New Mexico. Its nicknames, **The Duke City** and **Burque**, both reference its founding in 1706 as *La Villa de Alburquerque* by Nuevo México governor Francisco Cuervo y Valdés. Named in honor of the Viceroy of New Spain, the 10th Duke of Alburquerque, the city was an outpost on El Camino Real linking Mexico City to the northernmost territories of New Spain.

Located in the Albuquerque Basin, the city is flanked by the Sandia Mountains to the east and the West Mesa to the west, with the Rio Grande and bosque flowing from north-to-south. According to the 2020 census, Albuquerque had 564,559 residents, making it the 32nd-most populous city in the United States and the fourth largest in the Southwest. It is the principal city of the Albuquerque metropolitan area, which had 916,528 residents as of July 2020, and forms part of the Albuquerque–Santa Fe–Las Vegas combined statistical area, which numbers 1,162,523 as of January 2020.

Albuquerque is a hub for technology and media companies, historic landmarks, the University of New Mexico, the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, the Gathering of Nations, the New Mexico State Fair, as well as a diverse restaurant scene featuring both New Mexican cuisine and cuisines from around the world.
