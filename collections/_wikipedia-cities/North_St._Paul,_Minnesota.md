**North Saint Paul** (abbreviated North St. Paul) is a city in Ramsey County, Minnesota, United States, located east-northeast of the city of Saint Paul. The population was 11,460 at the 2010 census.

North Saint Paul is a distinct city, and not a neighborhood of nearby Saint Paul. This fact also contributes to a major difference from typical suburbs; rather than being composed of new developments and urban sprawl, many of the structures in town are older, including a downtown area of brick storefronts.

On the east side of the Margaret Street bridge over Minnesota State Highway 36 resides the 20-ton North Saint Paul Snowman. As the official city logo of North Saint Paul, it was constructed on Margaret and 7th Streets from 1971 to 1974 by Lloyd Koesling and moved to its current location in 1990.
