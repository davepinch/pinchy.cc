**Bellevue** (/ˈbɛlvjuː/ *BEL-vew*) is a city in the Eastside region of King County, Washington, United States, located across Lake Washington from Seattle. It is the third-largest city in the Seattle metropolitan area and has variously been characterized as a satellite city, a suburb, a boomburb, or an edge city. Its population was 122,363 at the 2010 census and 151,854 in the 2020 census. The city's name is derived from the French term *belle vue* ("beautiful view").

Bellevue is home to some of the world's largest technology companies.
