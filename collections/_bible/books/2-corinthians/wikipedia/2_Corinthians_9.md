**2 Corinthians 9** is the ninth chapter of the Second Epistle to the Corinthians in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It is authored by Paul the Apostle and Timothy (2 Corinthians 1:1) in Macedonia in 55–56 CE.

This chapter continues "the topic of generous giving" commenced in the previous chapter. The eighteenth-century German theologian Johann Salomo Semler suggested that this chapter was a separate letter later inserted into 2 Corinthians. The Jerusalem Bible notes the possibility that chapter 9 was "a short note to the churches of Achaia, being inserted here subsequently to follow the instructions on the same subject ... in chapter 8. The Pulpit Commentary rejects this suggestion.
