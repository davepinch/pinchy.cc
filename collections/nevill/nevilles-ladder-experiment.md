> Neville's Ladder Experiment 
>
> Note: If climbing a ladder is a common occurrence in your daily life, you can replace the ladder with something unusual but also something you don't care about (ex. finding a pink tennis ball). Instructions will use a ladder as the object of the experiment.   
>
> 1. Choose a comfortable position to fall asleep 
> 2. As you fall asleep, visualize climbing the ladder. Imagine taking the first step, reaching with your hand then the other, shifting your weight as you go higher and higher. How do the rungs of the ladder feel on your hands? On your feet? Make this visualization as real as possible, like you are actually climbing the ladder at that very moment. When you reach the top of the ladder, climb down again and repeat until you fall asleep. Do this for 3 nights. When you wake up and throughout the day, do not think about climbing a ladder, go out your way to find a ladder, or look for one. Only think about the ladder during the visualization exercise before you fall asleep. 
> 3. During the day, write multiple notes saying "I WILL NOT CLIMB A LADDER" and place these notes somewhere you will see them (bathroom mirror, computer screen, phone screen, etc.). Each time you see the note, acknowledge that you will not climb a ladder. Do this during the day for 3 days. 
> 4. The experiment is a success once you climb a ladder.
