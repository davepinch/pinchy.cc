**Aldebaran** is the brightest star in the zodiac constellation of Taurus. It has the Bayer designation **α Tauri**, which is Latinized to **Alpha Tauri** and abbreviated Alpha Tau or α Tau. Aldebaran varies in brightness from an apparent visual magnitude 0.75 down to 0.95, making it (typically) the fourteenth-brightest star in the night sky. It is located at a distance of approximately 65 light-years from the Sun. The star lies along the line of sight to the nearby Hyades cluster.

Aldebaran is a giant star that is cooler than the Sun with a surface temperature of 3,900 K, but its radius is about 44 times the Sun's, so it is over 400 times as luminous. It spins slowly and takes 520 days to complete a rotation. Aldebaran is believed to host a planet several times the mass of Jupiter, named Aldebaran b.

The planetary exploration probe Pioneer 10 is heading in the general direction of the star and should make its closest approach in about two million years.
