**Arcturus** is the brightest star in the northern constellation of [Boötes](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boötes). With an apparent visual magnitude of −0.05, it is the fourth-brightest of the individual stars in the night sky, and the brightest in the [northern celestial hemisphere](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_celestial_hemisphere). The name Arcturus originated from ancient Greece; it was then cataloged as α Boötis by Johann Bayer in 1603, which is Latinized to Alpha Boötis. Arcturus forms one corner of the Spring Triangle asterism.
