The **Big Bang** event is a physical theory that describes how the [universe]({% include cc-url for="Universe - Wikipedia" %}) expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature. Various cosmological models of the Big Bang explain the evolution of the [observable universe]({% include cc-url for="Observable universe - Wikipedia" %}) from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale form. These models offer a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and large-scale structure. The overall uniformity of the Universe, known as the flatness problem, is explained through cosmic inflation: a sudden and very rapid expansion of space during the earliest moments. However, physics currently lacks a widely accepted theory of quantum gravity that can successfully model the earliest conditions of the Big Bang.
