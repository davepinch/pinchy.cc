**Cassiopeia** is a constellation in the northern sky named after the vain queen Cassiopeia, mother of [Andromeda]({% include cc-url for="Andromeda (constellation) - Wikipedia" %}), in Greek mythology, who boasted about her unrivaled beauty. Cassiopeia was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century Greek astronomer [Ptolemy]({% include cc-url for="Ptolemy - Wikipedia" %}), and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations today. It is easily recognizable due to its distinctive 'W' shape, formed by five bright stars.
