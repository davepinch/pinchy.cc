**Centaurus** /sɛnˈtɔːrəs, -ˈtɑːr-/ is a bright constellation in the southern sky. One of the largest constellations, Centaurus was included among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. In Greek mythology, Centaurus represents a centaur; a creature that is half human, half horse (another constellation named after a centaur is one from the zodiac: Sagittarius). Notable stars include [Alpha Centauri]({% include cc-url for="Alpha Centauri - Wikipedia" %}), the nearest star system to the [Solar System]({% include cc-url for="Solar System - Wikipedia" %}), its neighbour in the sky Beta Centauri, and V766 Centauri, one of the largest stars yet discovered. The constellation also contains Omega Centauri, the brightest globular cluster as visible from Earth and the largest identified in the [Milky Way]({% include cc-url for="Milky Way - Wikipedia" %}), possibly a remnant of a dwarf galaxy.
