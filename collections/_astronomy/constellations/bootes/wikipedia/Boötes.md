**Boötes** (/boʊˈoʊtiːz/ *boh-OH-teez*) is a constellation in the northern sky, located between 0° and +60° declination, and 13 and 16 hours of right ascension on the celestial sphere. The name comes from Latin: *Boōtēs*, which comes from Greek: Βοώτης, translit. *Boṓtēs* 'herdsman' or 'plowman' (literally, 'ox-driver'; from βοῦς *boûs* 'cow').

One of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, Boötes is now one of the 88 modern constellations. It contains the fourth-brightest star in the night sky, the orange giant Arcturus. Epsilon Boötis, or Izar, is a colourful multiple star popular with amateur astronomers. Boötes is home to many other bright stars, including eight above the fourth magnitude and an additional 21 above the fifth magnitude, making a total of 29 stars easily visible to the naked eye.
