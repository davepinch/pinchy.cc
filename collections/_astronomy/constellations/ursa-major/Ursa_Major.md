**Ursa Major** (/ˈɜːrsə ˈmeɪdʒər/; also known as the **Great Bear**) is a constellation in the northern sky, whose associated mythology likely dates back into prehistory. Its Latin name means "greater (or larger) bear," referring to and contrasting it with nearby [Ursa Minor]({% include cc-url for="Ursa Minor - Wikipedia" %}), the lesser bear. In antiquity, it was one of the original 48 constellations listed by [Ptolemy]({% include cc-url for="Ptolemy - Wikipedia" %}) in the 2nd century AD, drawing on earlier works by Greek, Egyptian, Babylonian, and Assyrian astronomers. Today it is the third largest of the 88 modern constellations.
