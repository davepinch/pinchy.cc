**Crater** is a small constellation in the southern celestial hemisphere. Its name is the latinization of the Greek *krater*, a type of cup used to water down wine. One of the 48 constellations listed by the second-century astronomer [Ptolemy]({% include cc-url for="Ptolemy - Wikipedia" %}), it depicts a cup that has been associated with the god Apollo and is perched on the back of [Hydra]({% include cc-url for="Hydra (constellation) - Wikipedia" %}) the water snake.
