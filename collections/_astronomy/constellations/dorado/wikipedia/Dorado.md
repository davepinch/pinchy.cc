**Dorado** (US: /dɒˈreɪdoʊ, /also UK: /-ɑːdoʊ/) is a constellation in the southern sky. It was named in the late 16th century and is now one of the 88 modern constellations. Its name refers to the dolphinfish (*Coryphaena hippurus*), which is known as *dorado* in Spanish, although it has also been depicted as a swordfish. Dorado contains most of the Large Magellanic Cloud, the remainder being in the constellation Mensa. The South Ecliptic pole also lies within this constellation.

Even though the name Dorado is not Latin but Spanish, astronomers give it the Latin genitive form *Doradus* when naming its stars; it is treated (like the adjacent asterism Argo Navis) as a feminine proper name of Greek origin ending in -ō (like *Io* or *Callisto* or *Argo*), which have a genitive ending *-ūs*.
