**Piscis Austrinus** is a constellation in the southern celestial hemisphere. The name is Latin for "the southern fish", in contrast with the larger constellation [Pisces](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisces_(constellation)), which represents a pair of fish. Before the 20th century, it was also known as **Piscis Notius**. Piscis Austrinus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer [Ptolemy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy), and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. The stars of the modern constellation [Grus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grus_(constellation)) once formed the "tail" of Piscis Austrinus. In 1597 (or 1598), Petrus Plancius carved out a separate constellation and named it after the crane.
