The **Milky Way** is the galaxy that includes the [Solar System]({% include cc-url for="Solar System - Wikipedia" %}), with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term *Milky Way* is a translation of the Latin *via lactea*, from the Greek γαλακτικὸς κύκλος (*galaktikòs kýklos*), meaning "milky circle". From [Earth]({% include cc-url for="Earth - Wikipedia" %}), the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. [Galileo Galilei]({% include cc-url for="Galileo Galilei - Wikipedia" %}) first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Doust Curtis, observations by [Edwin Hubble]({% include cc-url for="Edwin Hubble - Wikipedia" %}) showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.
