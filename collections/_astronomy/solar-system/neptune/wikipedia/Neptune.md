**Neptune** is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known planet in the [Solar System]({% include cc-url for="Solar System - Wikipedia" %}). It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of [Earth]({% include cc-url for="Earth - Wikipedia" %}), and slightly more massive than its near-twin [Uranus]({% include cc-url for="Uranus - Wikipedia" %}). Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The planet orbits the [Sun]({% include cc-url for="Sun - Wikipedia" %}) once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol â™†, representing Neptune's trident.
