**Uranus** is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus (Caelus), who, according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares ([Mars]({% include cc-url for="Mars - Wikipedia" %})), grandfather of Zeus ([Jupiter]({% include cc-url for="Jupiter - Wikipedia" %})) and father of Cronus ([Saturn]({% include cc-url for="Saturn - Wikipedia" %})). It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the [Solar System]({% include cc-url for="Solar System - Wikipedia" %}). Uranus is similar in composition to [Neptune]({% include cc-url for="Neptune - Wikipedia" %}), and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the other giant planets.
