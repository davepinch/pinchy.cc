      In the Bible it is called Qer Harreseth or Kir of Moab, and is identified as having been subject to the Neo-Assyrian Empire; in the Books of Kings (2 Kings 16:9) and Book of Amos (Amos 1:5, 9:7), it is mentioned as the place where the Arameans went before they settled in the regions in the northern Levant, and to which Tiglath-Pileser III (r. 745–727 BC) sent the prisoners after the conquest of [Damascus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus).
