**Washington** (/ˈwɒʃɪŋtən/), officially the **State of Washington** and often referred to as **Washington state** to distinguish it from the national capital, Washington, D.C., is a state in the [Pacific Northwest](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest) region of the [Western United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States). Named for [George Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington)—the first U.S. president—the state was formed from the western part of the Washington Territory, which was ceded by the British Empire in 1846, by the Oregon Treaty in the settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute. The state is bordered on the west by the [Pacific Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean), [Oregon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon) to the south, [Idaho](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho) to the east, and the Canadian province of [British Columbia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia) to the north. It was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. [Olympia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia,_Washington) is the state capital; the state's largest city is [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle).
