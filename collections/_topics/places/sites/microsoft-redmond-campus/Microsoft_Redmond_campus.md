The **Microsoft campus** is the corporate headquarters of Microsoft, located in [Redmond](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)), [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), a part of the [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle) metropolitan area. Microsoft initially moved onto the grounds of the campus on February 26, 1986, shortly before going public on March 13. The headquarters has undergone multiple expansions since its establishment and is presently estimated to encompass over 8 million square feet (740,000 m2) of office space and have over 50,000 employees.
