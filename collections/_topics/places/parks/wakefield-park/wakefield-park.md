* My parents brought me and my brothers sledding here one [winter](/winter/).

When I was a kid:

* Once I biked around the neighborhood along both sides of the lake.
* On mornings after the 4th of July, I would walk to the park with my brothers or friends to search for unused fire crackers.
* I remember one year sitting in the car waiting to see the fireworks.
* This park had an open drain I explored a few times with friends.
* In one exploration I cut my foot from glass.
* My friend John Shingler ripped his shirt off so I could use it wrap my foot.
* I needed stitches.
* Even today, there is a part of my toe I cannot feel.

Some years later I returned with my brother and friend to explore the old drain in the park. The drain was closed.
