> The **Bronze Age** is a historic period, lasting approximately from 3300 BC to 1200 BC, characterized by the use of [bronze](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze), the presence of writing in some areas, and other early features of urban civilization. The Bronze Age is the second principal period of the three-age system proposed in 1836 by Christian JÃ¼rgensen Thomsen for classifying and studying ancient societies and history. It is also considered the second phase, of three, in the Metal Ages.
