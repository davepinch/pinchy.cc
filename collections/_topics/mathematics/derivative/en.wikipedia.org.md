> In mathematics, the **derivative** shows the sensitivity of change of a function's output with respect to the input. Derivatives are a fundamental tool of [calculus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus). For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the object's velocity: this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances.
