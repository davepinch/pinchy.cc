***The Wall*** is the eleventh studio album by the English [progressive rock](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock) band [Pink Floyd](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd), released on 30 November 1979 by Harvest/EMI and Columbia/CBS Records. It is a rock opera that explores Pink, a jaded rock star whose eventual self-imposed isolation from society forms a figurative wall. The album was a commercial success, topping the US charts for 15 weeks and reaching number three in the UK. It initially received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom found it overblown and pretentious, but later received accolades as one of the greatest albums of all time.
