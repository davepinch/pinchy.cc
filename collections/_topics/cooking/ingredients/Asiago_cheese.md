    **Asiago** (UK: /ˌæsiˈɑːɡoʊ, ˌæzi-/ *ASS-ee-AH-goh*, *AZ*-, US: /ˌɑːsi-, ˌɑːʒi-, ˌɑːʃi-/ *AH-s(h)ee*-, *AH-zhee*-, Italian: [aˈzjaːɡo]) is a cow's milk cheese, first produced in Asiago in [Italy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy), that can assume different textures according to its aging, from smooth for the fresh Asiago (called *Asiago Pressato*, which means 'Pressed Asiago') to a crumbly texture for the aged cheese (*Asiago d'allevo*, which means 'Breeding farm Asiago').
