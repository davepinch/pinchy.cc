> ***Nineteen Eighty-Four*** (also published as ***1984***) is a dystopian social science fiction novel and cautionary tale by English writer [George Orwell](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell). It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, it centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance and repressive regimentation of people and behaviours within society. Orwell, a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian state in the novel on the Soviet Union in the era of Stalinism, and Nazi Germany. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within societies and the ways in which they can be manipulated.
