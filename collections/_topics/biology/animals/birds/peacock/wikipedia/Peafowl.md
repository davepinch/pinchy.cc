**Peafowl** is a common name for three bird species in the genera Pavo and Afropavo within the tribe Pavonini of the family Phasianidae, the pheasants and their allies. Male peafowl are referred to as **peacocks**, and female peafowl are referred to as **peahens**, although peafowl of either sex are often referred to colloquially as "peacocks."
