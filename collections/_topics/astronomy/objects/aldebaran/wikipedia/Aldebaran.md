      Aldebaran is a red giant, meaning that it is cooler than the [Sun](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun) with a surface temperature of 3,900 K, but its radius is about 44 times the Sun's, so it is over 400 times as luminous.

      The traditional name Aldebaran derives from the Arabic *al Dabarān* (الدبران), meaning 'the follower', because it seems to follow the [Pleiades](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades).

      The star is, by chance, in the line of sight between the [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) and the Hyades, so it has the appearance of being the brightest member of the open cluster, but the cluster that forms the bull's-head-shaped asterism is more than twice as far away, at about 150 light years.

      Aldebaran is 5.47 degrees south of the ecliptic and so can be occulted by the [Moon](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon). Such occultations occur when the Moon's ascending node is near the autumnal equinox.
