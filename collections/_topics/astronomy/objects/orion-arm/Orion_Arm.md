      The Orion Arm is a minor spiral arm of the [Milky Way Galaxy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) that is 3,500 light-years (1,100 parsecs) across and approximately 10,000 light-years (3,100 parsecs) in length, containing the [Solar System](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System), including [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth).

      Within the arm, the [Solar System](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System) is close to its inner rim, in a relative cavity in the arm's interstellar medium known as the [Local Bubble](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Bubble), about halfway along the arm's length, approximately 8,000 parsecs (26,000 light-years) from the Galactic Center.
