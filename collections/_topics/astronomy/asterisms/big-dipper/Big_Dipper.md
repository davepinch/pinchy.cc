      The Big Dipper (US, Canada) or the Plough (UK, Ireland) is a large asterism consisting of seven bright stars of the constellation [Ursa Major](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major); six of them are of second magnitude and one, [Megrez](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Ursae_Majoris) (δ), of third magnitude.

      The North Star ([Polaris](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris)), the current northern pole star and the tip of the handle of the Little Dipper (Little Bear), can be located by extending an imaginary line through the front two stars of the asterism, Merak (β) and Dubhe (α).

      Five of the stars of the Big Dipper are at the core of the [Ursa Major Moving Group](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major_moving_group). The two at the ends, Dubhe and Alkaid, are not part of the swarm, and are moving in the opposite direction.

      Extending a line from Phecda (γ) to Megrez (δ) leads to [Thuban](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuban) (α Draconis), which was the pole star 4,000 years ago.

      By following the curve of the handle from Alioth (ε) to [Mizar](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizar) (ζ) to Alkaid (η), one reaches [Arcturus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcturus) (α Boötis) and Spica (α Virginis). A mnemonic for this is "Arc to Arcturus then speed (or spike) to Spica."

      The approximate location of the Hubble Deep Field can be found by following a line from Phecda (γ) to [Megrez](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Ursae_Majoris) (δ) and continuing on for the same distance again.
