**Lyra** (Latin for 'lyre', from Ancient Greek: λύρα /ˈlaɪrə/ LY-rə) is a small constellation. It is one of the 48 listed by the 2nd century astronomer [Ptolemy](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy), and is one of the modern 88 constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union. Lyra was often represented on star maps as a vulture or an eagle carrying a lyre, and hence is sometimes referred to as **Vultur Cadens** or **Aquila Cadens** ("Falling Vulture" or "Falling Eagle"), respectively. Beginning at the north, Lyra is bordered by [Draco](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draco_(constellation)), [Hercules](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_(constellation)), [Vulpecula](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulpecula), and [Cygnus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_(constellation)). Lyra is nearly overhead in temperate northern latitudes shortly after midnight at the start of summer. From the equator to about the 40th parallel south it is visible low in the northern sky during the same (thus winter) months.
