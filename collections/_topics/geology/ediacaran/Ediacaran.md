moon: "The relative proximity of the Moon at this time meant that tides were stronger and more rapid than they are now. The day was 21.9 ± 0.4 hours, and there were 13.1 ± 0.1 synodic months/year and 400 ± 7 solar days/year."
multicellular-organism: "The Ediacaran marks the first appearance of widespread multicellular fauna following the end of Snowball Earth glaciation events, the so-called Ediacaran biota, which is represented by now-extinct relatively simple animal phyla such as Proarticulata (bilaterians with articulation including *Dickinsonia* and *Spriggina*), Petalonamae (sea pen-like animals including *Charnia*), Disc-shaped forms (radial-shaped animals including *Cyclomedusa*) and Trilobozoa (animals with tri-radial symmetry including *Tribrachidium*)."
