The **Juan de Fuca Plate** is a small tectonic plate (microplate) generated from the Juan de Fuca Ridge that is subducting beneath the northerly portion of the western side of the North American Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone. It is named after the explorer of the same name. One of the smallest of [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth)'s tectonic plates, the Juan de Fuca Plate is a remnant part of the once-vast [Farallon Plate](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farallon_Plate), which is now largely subducted underneath the North American Plate.
