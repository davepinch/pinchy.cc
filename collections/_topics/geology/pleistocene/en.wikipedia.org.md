    At the end of the preceding Pliocene, the previously isolated [North](/north-america/) and [South American](/south-america/) continents were joined by the Isthmus of Panama, causing a faunal interchange between the two regions and changing ocean circulation patterns, with the onset of glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere occurring around 2.7 million years ago.
