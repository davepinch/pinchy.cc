The **Eocene** (IPA: /ˈiːəsiːn, ˈiːoʊ-/ *EE-ə-seen*, *EE-oh-*) Epoch is a geological epoch that lasted from about 56 to 33.9 million years ago (Ma). It is the second epoch of the Paleogene Period in the modern Cenozoic Era. The name Eocene comes from the Ancient Greek ἠώς (*ēṓs*, "dawn") and καινός (*kainós*, "new") and refers to the "dawn" of modern ('new') fauna that appeared during the epoch.
