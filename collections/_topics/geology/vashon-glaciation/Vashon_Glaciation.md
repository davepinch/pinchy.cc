    The **Vashon Glaciation**, **Vashon Stadial** or **Vashon Stade** is a local term for the most recent period of very cold climate in which during its peak, glaciers covered the entire Salish Sea as well as present day [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle), [Tacoma](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma,_Washington), [Olympia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia,_Washington) and other surrounding areas in the western part of present-day [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)) (state) of the [United States of America](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States).

    The Vashon Glaciation lasted from about 19,000 – 16,000 BP (Before Present – present defined as January 1, 1950 for this scale).

    The Vashon Glaciation is an extension of the Fraser Glaciation in which the [Cordilleran Ice Sheet](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordilleran_ice_sheet) advanced south of the present day Canada–United States border into the Puget Sound region.

    During the Vashon glaciation, the climate in Western Washington, like most places, was much colder than today. As well as being cold, it was also much drier than in current times, which was characteristic of some places, and opposite of others.

    The advance of the [Cordilleran Ice Sheet](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordilleran_ice_sheet) actually began long before 19,000 years ago. However, 19,000 years ago marks the approximate time when glaciers crossed the present-day Canada–United States border into Western Washington, which is generally considered to be the beginning of the Vashon Glaciation.
