    About 16,900 years ago, the Vashon glacier begins to melt and recede from lands that will come to be known as the Puget Sound region and the Columbia Basin region. By 15,000 years ago, the glacier has retreated to the border of present-day Canada. During its advance, meltwater flowing under the ice sheet had carved out Lake Washington, Lake Tapps, Lake Sammamish, Puget Sound, and Hood Canal.

    The Vashon stade was the last glacial advance and retreat to cover the region. It was the last of at least seven glaciations during the Pleistocene Epoch, which lasted from two million years b.p. (before present) to about 10,000 years b.p.

    Along the north side of the Olympic Mountains the Juan de Fuca Lobe moved west, and between the Olympics and the Cascades the Puget Lobe moved south.

    In the Puget Lowlands, the Puget Lobe shaped much of the topography below 3,000 feet. As the Puget Lobe advanced, it deposited hundreds of feet of Lawton Clay, Esperance Sand, and Vashon Till. Meltwater flowing below the ice carved out troughs that we know as valleys.
