  The advance of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet actually began long before 19,000 years ago. However, 19,000 years ago marks the approximate time when glaciers crossed the present-day Canadaâ€“United States border into Western Washington, which is generally considered to be the beginning of the Vashon Glaciation.
