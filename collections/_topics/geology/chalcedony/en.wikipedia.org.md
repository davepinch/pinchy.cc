**Chalcedony** (/kælˈsɛdəni/ *kal-SED-ə-nee*, or /ˈkælsəˌdoʊni/ *KAL-sə-doh-nee*) is a cryptocrystalline form of silica, composed of very fine intergrowths of quartz and moganite. These are both silica minerals, but they differ in that quartz has a trigonal crystal structure, while moganite is monoclinic. Chalcedony's standard chemical structure (based on the chemical structure of quartz) is SiO2 (silicon dioxide).
