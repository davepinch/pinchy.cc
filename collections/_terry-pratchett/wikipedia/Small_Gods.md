***Small Gods*** is the thirteenth of Terry Pratchett's *Discworld* novels, published in 1992. It tells the origin of the god Om, and his relations with his prophet, the reformer Brutha. In the process, it satirises religious institutions, people, and practices, and the role of religion in political life.
