***Equal Rites*** is a comic fantasy novel by Terry Pratchett. Published in 1987, it is the third novel in the *Discworld* series and the first in which the main character is not Rincewind. The title is wordplay on the phrase "Equal Rights".

The novel introduces the character of Granny Weatherwax, who reappears in several later Discworld novels. The protagonist Eskarina Smith does not return until *I Shall Wear Midnight*, which was published 23 years later.

Pratchett based the character Esk on his daughter Rhianna Pratchett.
