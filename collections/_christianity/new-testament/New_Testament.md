The **New Testament** (**NT**) is the second division of the Christian biblical canon. It discusses the teachings and person of [Jesus](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus), as well as events in first-century Christianity. The New Testament's background, the first division of the Christian Bible, is called the [Old Testament](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament), which is based primarily upon the Hebrew Bible; together they are regarded as sacred scripture by Christians.
