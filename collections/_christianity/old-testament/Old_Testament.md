The **Old Testament** (**OT**) is the first division of the Christian biblical canon, which is based primarily upon the 24 books of the Hebrew Bible or Tanakh, a collection of ancient religious Hebrew and occasionally Aramaic writings by the Israelites. The second division of Christian Bibles is the [New Testament](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament), written in the Koine Greek language.
