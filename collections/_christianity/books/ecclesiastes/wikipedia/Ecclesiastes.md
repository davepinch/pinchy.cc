**Ecclesiastes** (/ɪˌkliːziˈæstiːz/; Biblical Hebrew: קֹהֶלֶת, romanized: *qōheleṯ*, Ancient Greek: *Ἐκκλησιαστής*, romanized: *Ekklēsiastēs*) is one of the Ketuvim ("Writings") of the Hebrew Bible and part of the Wisdom literature of the Christian Old Testament. The title commonly used in English is a Latin transliteration of the Greek translation of the Hebrew word קֹהֶלֶת (*Kohelet*, *Koheleth*, *Qoheleth* or *Qohelet*). An unnamed author introduces "The words of Kohelet, son of David, king in Jerusalem" (1:1) and does not use his own voice again until the final verses (12:9–14), where he gives his own thoughts and summarises the statements of Kohelet; the main body of the text is ascribed to Kohelet himself.
