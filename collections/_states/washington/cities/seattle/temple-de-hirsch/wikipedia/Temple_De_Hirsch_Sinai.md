**Temple De Hirsch Sinai** is a Reform Jewish congregation with campuses in Seattle and nearby Bellevue, Washington, USA. It was formed as a 1971 merger between the earlier **Temple De Hirsch** (Seattle, founded 1899) and **Temple Sinai** (Bellevue, founded 1961) and is the largest Reform congregation in the Pacific Northwest. [¶]({% link _symbols/pilcrow.md %}) The old Temple De Hirsch building (or Old Sanctuary) was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but was demolished in 1993. Part of the façade remains.
