**Magnolia** is the second largest neighborhood of [Seattle]({% include cc-url for="Seattle - Wikipedia" %}), Washington by area. It occupies a hilly peninsula northwest of [downtown]({% include cc-url for="downtown" %}). Magnolia has been a part of the city since 1891. A good portion of the peninsula is taken up by Discovery Park, formerly the U.S. Army's Fort Lawton.

Magnolia is isolated from the rest of Seattle, connected by road to the rest of the city by only three bridges over the tracks of the BNSF Railway: W. Emerson Street in the north, W. Dravus Street in the center, and W. Garfield Street (the Magnolia Bridge) in the south â€” the Salmon Bay Bridge to Ballard is rail-only, no motorized traffic is permitted to cross the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks, and the W. Fort Street bridge over the railroad tracks only affords access to the W. Commodore Way industrial area (traffic to the rest of the city from that area still needs to take the W. Emerson Street bridge).
