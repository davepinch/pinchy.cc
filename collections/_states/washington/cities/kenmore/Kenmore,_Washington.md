**Kenmore** is a city in King County, Washington, United States, along the northernmost shore of Lake Washington. It is a suburban commuter town at the mouth of the Sammamish River, 12 miles (19 km) northeast of downtown Seattle and 2 miles (3.2 km) west of Bothell. The population was 20,460 at the 2010 census. Kenmore Air Harbor is the largest seaplane-only passenger facility of its kind in the United States.

Kenmore is connected to nearby areas by State Route 522 and the Burke-Gilman Trail, which both run east–west along the lakeshore. The city limits stretch north to the Snohomish County line and south to a border with Kirkland south of Saint Edward State Park and Bastyr University. Kenmore's official flower is the dahlia, bird the great blue heron, and evergreen the rhododendron.
