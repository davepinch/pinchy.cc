**Deming** is a census-designated place (CDP) in Whatcom County, Washington, United States, along the Nooksack River. It is named for its first postmaster, George Deming. The community population was 353 at the 2010 census.

Located about 16.3 miles from the county seat and major city of Bellingham, this small community is home to the tribal government offices of the federally recognized Nooksack Tribe and is situated within the tribe's 2500-acre Nooksack Indian Reservation.

Deming and the nearby town of Van Zandt are served by their own local community radio station, KAVZ-LP which transmits with 100 watts from the Van Zandt Community Hall, and has a receiving radius of about 15 miles.
