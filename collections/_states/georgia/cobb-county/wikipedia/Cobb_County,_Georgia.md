**Cobb County** is a county in the U.S. state of Georgia, located in the Atlanta metropolitan area in the north central portion of the state. As of 2020 Census, the population was 766,149. Its county seat and largest city is Marietta.

Along with several adjoining counties, Cobb County was created on December 3, 1832, by the Georgia General Assembly from the large Cherokee County territoryâ€”land northwest of the Chattahoochee River which the state acquired from the Cherokee Nation and redistributed to settlers via lottery, following the passage of the federal Indian Removal Act. The county was named for Thomas Willis Cobb, a U.S. representative and senator from Georgia. It is believed that Marietta was named for his wife, Mary.

Cobb County is included in the Atlanta metropolitan area and is situated immediately to the northwest of Atlanta's city limits.

Its Cumberland District, an edge city, has over 24 million square feet (2,200,000 m2) of office space. Major League Baseball's Atlanta Braves have played at Truist Park in Cumberland since 2017.

In 2003, the U.S. Census Bureau ranked Cobb County as the most educated in the state of Georgia and 12th-most in the United States. It has ranked among the top 100 highest-income counties in the United States. In October 2017, Cobb was ranked as the "Least Obese County in Georgia".
