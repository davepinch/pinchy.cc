**Psilocin** (also known as **4-HO-DMT**, **4-hydroxy DMT**, **psilocine**, **psilocyn**, or **psilotsin**) is a substituted tryptamine alkaloid and a serotonergic psychedelic substance. It is present in most psychedelic mushrooms together with its phosphorylated counterpart psilocybin. Psilocin is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Acting on the 5-HT2A receptors, psilocin modulates the production and reuptake of serotonin. The mind-altering effects of psilocin are highly variable and subjective and resemble those of [LSD](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide) and [DMT](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine).
