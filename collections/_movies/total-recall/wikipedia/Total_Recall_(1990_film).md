**Total Recall** is a 1990 American [science fiction](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction) action film directed by [Paul Verhoeven](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Verhoeven), with a screenplay by Ronald Shusett, Dan O'Bannon, and Gary Goldman. The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rachel Ticotin, Sharon Stone, Ronny Cox, and Michael Ironside. Based on the 1966 short story "We Can Remember It for You Wholesale" by [Philip K. Dick](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick), Total Recall tells the story of Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger), a construction worker who receives an implanted memory of a fantastical adventure on [Mars](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars). He subsequently finds his adventure occurring in [reality](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality) as agents of a shadow organization try to prevent him from recovering memories of his past as a Martian secret agent aiming to stop the tyrannical regime of Martian dictator Vilos Cohaagen (Cox).
