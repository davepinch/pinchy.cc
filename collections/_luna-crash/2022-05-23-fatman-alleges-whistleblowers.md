> In the past 48 hours I have been contacted by several whistleblowers. These people would like to and will stay anonymous. I have learned some deeply troubling things and there is a lot more to come - this is just the very beginning. Here is some of what I can tell you.

> @stablekwon I know about the bailout from Jump in May 2021 and I know exactly how much you owe them every month in LUNA (hint: how many zeroes in a million?)

> @jump_ I know exactly what you did to manipulate retail into losing billions on UST but especially LUNA

> @KanavKariya I know who controls you behind the scenes (B); I know about your Slack group having a 14 day retention window

> @SBF_FTX I know about the 30% Serum handshake deal with Jump and what you did to retail investors after

> There is far more that I cannot say, but know that I know, and know that justice is coming, because this time I think you went too far - this time you killed people - someone has to fight for them. If I go, someone will take my place. This is nothing - just the start. Go time.
