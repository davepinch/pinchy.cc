When I was a kid:

* This park has an open drain I explored a few times with friends.
* In one exploration I cut my foot open from glass and needed stitches.
* There is a part of my toe I cannot feel even today, 30+ years later.
* Once I biked around the neighborhood along both sides of the lake.
* On mornings after the 4th of July, I would walk to the park with my brothers or friends to search for unused fire crackers.
* I remember one year sitting in the car waiting to see the fireworks.

Some years later I returned with my brother and friend to explore the old drain in the park. The drain was closed.
