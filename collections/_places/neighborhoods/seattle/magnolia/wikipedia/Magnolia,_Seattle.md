**Magnolia** is the second largest neighborhood of [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)) by area. It occupies a hilly peninsula northwest of downtown. Magnolia has been a part of the city since 1891. A good portion of the peninsula is taken up by Discovery Park, formerly the U.S. Army's Fort Lawton.
