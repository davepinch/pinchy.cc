**West Seattle** is a conglomeration of neighborhoods in [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)), [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). It comprises two of the thirteen districts, Delridge and Southwest, and encompasses all of Seattle west of the Duwamish River. It was incorporated as an independent town in 1902 before being annexed by Seattle five years later. Among the area's attractions are its saltwater beach parks along Elliott Bay and Puget Sound, including Alki Beach Park and Lincoln Park. The area is also known for its views of the Olympic Mountains to the west and the Cascade Range to the east. One-third of Seattle's green space and urban forest is located in West Seattle, much of it in the West Duwamish Greenbelt.
