**Ballard** is a neighborhood in the northwestern area of [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle), [Washington]([Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state))), [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). Formerly an independent city, the City of Seattle's official boundaries define it as bounded to the north by Crown Hill (N.W. 85th Street), to the east by Greenwood, Phinney Ridge and [Fremont](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont,_Seattle) (along 3rd Avenue N.W.), to the south by the Lake Washington Ship Canal, and to the west by [Puget Sound](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound)'s Shilshole Bay. Other neighborhood or district boundaries existed in the past; these are recognized by various Seattle City Departments, commercial or social organizations, and other Federal, State, and local government agencies.
