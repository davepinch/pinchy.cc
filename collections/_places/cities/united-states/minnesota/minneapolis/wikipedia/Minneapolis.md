**Minneapolis** (/ˌmɪniˈæpəlɪs/ (listen) MIN-ee-AP-əl-iss), officially the **City of Minneapolis**, is a city in the state of [Minnesota](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota) and the county seat of [Hennepin County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hennepin_County,_Minnesota). As of the 2020 census the population was 429,954, making it the largest city in Minnesota and the 46th-most-populous in the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). Nicknamed the "City of Lakes", Minneapolis is abundant in water, with thirteen lakes, wetlands, the [Mississippi River](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River), creeks, and waterfalls. Minneapolis has its origins as the 19th century lumber and flour milling capitals of the world, and, to the present day, preserved its financial clout. It occupies both banks of the Mississippi River and adjoins [Saint Paul](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Paul,_Minnesota), the state capital of Minnesota.
