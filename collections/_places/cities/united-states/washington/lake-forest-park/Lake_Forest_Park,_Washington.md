**Lake Forest Park** is a suburban city in King County, Washington, United States, located northeast of Seattle. It was developed in the 20th century as a bedroom community with single-family housing on medium to large-sized lots. Less than 4% of the city's land is zoned commercial, largely concentrated in one location, and there are no industrial areas.
