The **Cascade Range** or **Cascades** is a major mountain range of western North America, extending from southern British Columbia through [Washington]({% include cc-url for="Washington (state) - Wikipedia" %}) and Oregon to Northern California. It includes both non-volcanic mountains, such as many of those in the North Cascades, and the notable volcanoes known as the **High Cascades**. The small part of the range in British Columbia is referred to as the **Canadian Cascades** or, locally, as the **Cascade Mountains**. The highest peak in the range is [Mount Rainier]({% include cc-url for="Mount Rainier - Wikipedia" %}) in Washington at 14,411 feet (4,392 m).
