**Jordan** (Arabic: الأردن, romanized: *al-ʾUrdunn* [al.ʔur.dunː]), officially the **Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan**, is a country in Western Asia. It is situated at the crossroads of Asia, Africa, and Europe, within the Levant region, on the East Bank of the Jordan River. Jordan is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the south and east, Iraq to the northeast, [Syria](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria) to the north, and the Palestinian West Bank and Israel to the west. The Dead Sea is located along its western border and the country has a 26 km (16 mi) coastline in its southwest on the Gulf of Aqaba's Red Sea, which separates Jordan from Egypt. [Amman](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amman) is Jordan's capital and largest city, as well as its economic, political, and cultural centre.
