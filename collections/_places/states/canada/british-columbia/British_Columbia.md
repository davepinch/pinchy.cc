**British Columbia** (commonly abbreviated as **BC**) is the westernmost province of [Canada](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada). Situated between the [Pacific Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean) and the Rocky Mountains, the province has a diverse geography, with rugged landscapes that include rocky coastlines, sandy beaches, forests, lakes, mountains, inland deserts and grassy plains. British Columbia borders the province of Alberta to the east, the territories of Yukon and the Northwest Territories to the north, and the US states of [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)), [Idaho](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho) and [Montana](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana) to the south and [Alaska](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska) to the northwest. With an estimated population of over 5.3 million as of 2023, it is Canada's third-most populous province. The capital of British Columbia is Victoria, while the province's largest city is Vancouver. Vancouver and its suburbs together make up the third-largest metropolitan area in Canada; with the 2021 census recording 2.6 million people in Metro Vancouver.
