**Michigan** (/ˈmɪʃɪɡən/) is a state in the Great Lakes region of the [upper](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Midwest) [Midwestern](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States) United States. It has land borders with [Wisconsin](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin) to the southwest, and [Indiana](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana) and [Ohio](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio) to the south, and Lakes [Superior](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Superior), [Michigan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Michigan), Huron, and [Erie](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Erie) also connect it to the states of [Minnesota](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota) and [Illinois](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois), and the Canadian province of Ontario. With a population of nearly 10.12 million and an area of nearly 97,000 sq mi (250,000 km2), Michigan is the 10th-largest state by population, the 11th-largest by area, and the largest by area east of the Mississippi River. Its capital is Lansing, and its largest city is [Detroit](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit). Metro Detroit is among the nation's most populous and largest metropolitan economies. Its name derives from a gallicized variant of the original Ojibwe word ᒥᓯᑲᒥ (*mishigami*), meaning "large water" or "large lake".
