**New Mexico** (Spanish: *Nuevo México* [ˈnweβo ˈmexiko]; Navajo: *Yootó Hahoodzo* Navajo pronunciation: [jòːtʰó hɑ̀hòːtsò]) is a state in the [Southwestern United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States). It is one of the Mountain States of the southern Rocky Mountains, sharing the Four Corners region of the western U.S. with [Utah](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah), [Colorado](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado), and [Arizona](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona), and bordering [Texas](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas) to the east and southeast, [Oklahoma](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma) to the northeast, and the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Sonora to the south. New Mexico's largest city is [Albuquerque](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico), and its state capital is Santa Fe, the oldest state capital in the U.S., founded in 1610 as the government seat of Nuevo México in New Spain.
