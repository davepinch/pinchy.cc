**Oregon** (/ˈɒrɪɡən/) is a state in the [Pacific Northwest](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest) region of the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). Oregon is a part of the [Western United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States), with the [Columbia River](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_River) delineating much of Oregon's northern boundary with [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)), while the Snake River delineates much of its eastern boundary with [Idaho](Idaho - Wikipedia). The 42° north parallel delineates the southern boundary with [California](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California) and [Nevada](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada).
