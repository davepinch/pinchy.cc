**Hawaii** (/həˈwaɪi/ *hə-WY-ee*; Hawaiian: *Hawaiʻi*, [həˈvɐjʔi] or [həˈwɐjʔi]) is a state in the [Western United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States), about 2,000 miles (3,200 km) from the U.S. mainland in the [Pacific Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean). It is the only U.S. state outside North America, the only state that is an archipelago, and the only state in the tropics.
