**North America** is a continent in the Northern Hemisphere and almost entirely within the Western Hemisphere. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the [Atlantic Ocean]({% include cc-url for="Atlantic Ocean - Wikipedia" %}), to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea, and to the west and south by the [Pacific Ocean]({% include cc-url for="Pacific Ocean - Wikipedia" %}). Because it is on the North American Tectonic Plate, Greenland is included as a part of North America geographically.
