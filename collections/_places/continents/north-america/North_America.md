**North America** is a continent in the Northern Hemisphere and almost entirely within the Western Hemisphere. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean), to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea, and to the west and south by the [Pacific Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean). Because it is on the North American Tectonic Plate, Greenland is included as a part of North America geographically.
