***Grandfather Cuts Loose the Ponies*** (also known as the **Wild Horse Monument**) is a public art sculpture created by David Govedare in 1989â€“1990 and situated near [Vantage](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vantage,_Washington), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)). It consists of 15 life-size steel horses which appear to be galloping across a ridge above the [Columbia River](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_River). Presented as a gift for the centenary of Washington's statehood, the sculpture was conceived as a memorial to the wild horses which once roamed the region. According to the Seattle Times, it is one of the most-seen public artworks in Washington state.
