The **Gum Wall** is a brick wall covered in used chewing gum under Pike Place Market in Downtown [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)), [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). It is located on Post Alley near Pike Street, south of the market's main entrance off 1st Avenue. Parts of the gum coating alongside the walls are several inches thick, and the coating is 15 feet (4.6 m) high along a 50-foot-long (15 m) section. The Market Theater Gum Wall has become a tourist attraction and local landmark since it was unintentionally created in the 1990s.
