The **Vantage Bridge** is a bridge in the U.S. state of [Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)). It carries [Interstate 90](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_90) across the [Columbia River](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_River), near Vantage and George, Washington. This section of the river is named Wanapum Lake; it is the reservoir formed by Wanapum Dam. The bridge separates the Ginkgo Petrified Forest and Wanapum Recreational Area State Park on the western bank of the Columbia.
