**Broadway** is a major northâ€“south thoroughfare in [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)). The 1.6-mile-long (2.6 km) arterial runs north from Yesler Way at Yesler Terrace through the [First Hill](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Hill,_Seattle) and [Capitol Hill](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill,_Seattle) neighborhoods to East Roy Street. Broadway East (the directional designation changes at East Denny Way) continues north to East Highland Drive. North of there the street is made up of shorter segments: one from just south of East Blaine Street to just north of East Miller Street, another from East Roanoke Street to East Shelby Street, and the last from East Allison Street to Fuhrman Avenue East.
