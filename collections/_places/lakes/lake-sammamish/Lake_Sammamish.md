**Lake Sammamish** is a freshwater lake 8 miles (13 km) east of [Seattle]({% include cc-url for="Seattle - Wikipedia" %}) in [King County]({% include cc-url for="King County, Washington - Wikipedia" %}), [Washington]({% include cc-url for="Washington (state) - Wikipedia" %}), United States. The lake is 7 miles (11 km) long and 1.5 miles (2 km) wide, with a maximum depth of 105 feet (32 m) and a surface area of 8 sq mi (21 km2). It lies east of [Lake Washington]({% include cc-url for="Lake Washington - Wikipedia" %}) and west of the Sammamish Plateau, and stretches from [Issaquah]({% include cc-url for="Issaquah, Washington - Wikipedia" %}) in the south to [Redmond]({% include cc-url for="Redmond, Washington - Wikipedia" %}) in the north. At Issaquah it is fed by Issaquah Creek, and at Redmond it drains to Lake Washington via the Sammamish River, named after the native people who once lived along its entire length.
