**Chelan County** (/ʃəˈlæn/, shə-LAN) is a county in the U.S. state of [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)). As of the 2020 census, its population was 79,074. The county seat and largest city is [Wenatchee](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenatchee,_Washington). The county was created out of [Okanogan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okanogan_County,_Washington) and [Kittitas](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kittitas_County,_Washington) Counties on March 13, 1899. It derives its name from a Chelan Indian word meaning "deep water," likely a reference to 55-mile (89 km)-long Lake Chelan, which reaches a maximum depth of 1,486 feet (453 m).
