**Puget Sound** (/ˈpjuːdʒɪt/ *PEW-jit*) is a sound of the [Pacific Northwest](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest), an inlet of the [Pacific Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean), and part of the Salish Sea. It is located along the northwestern coast of the U.S. state of [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)). It is a complex estuarine system of interconnected marine waterways and basins, with one major and two minor connections to the open Pacific Ocean via the Strait of Juan de Fuca—Admiralty Inlet being the major connection and Deception Pass and Swinomish Channel being the minor.
