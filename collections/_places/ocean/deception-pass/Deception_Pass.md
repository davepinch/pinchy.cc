**Deception Pass** (Lushootseed: sčudᶻ) (Samish: Xwchsónges) is a strait separating [Whidbey Island](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whidbey_Island) from [Fidalgo Island](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidalgo_Island), in the northwest part of the U.S. state of [Washington]([Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state))). It connects Skagit Bay, part of [Puget Sound](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound), with the Strait of Juan de Fuca. A pair of bridges known collectively as [Deception Pass Bridge](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception_Pass_Bridge) cross Deception Pass. The bridges were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.
