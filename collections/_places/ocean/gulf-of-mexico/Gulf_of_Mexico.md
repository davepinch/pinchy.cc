The **Gulf of Mexico** (Spanish: *Golfo de México*) is an ocean basin and a marginal sea of the [Atlantic Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean), mostly surrounded by the [North American](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America) continent. It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States); on the southwest and south by the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche, Yucatán, and Quintana Roo; and on the southeast by Cuba. The Southern U.S. states of [Texas](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas), [Louisiana](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana), [Mississippi](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi), [Alabama](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama), and [Florida](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida), which border the Gulf on the north, are often referred to as the "Third Coast" of the United States (in addition to its Atlantic and Pacific coasts).
