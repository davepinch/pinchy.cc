The **Gulf of Mexico** (Spanish: *Golfo de México*) is an ocean basin and a marginal sea of the [Atlantic Ocean]({% include cc-url for="Atlantic Ocean - Wikipedia" %}), mostly surrounded by the [North American]({% include cc-url for="North America - Wikipedia" %}) continent. It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States; on the southwest and south by the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche, Yucatán, and Quintana Roo; and on the southeast by Cuba. The Southern U.S. states of [Texas]({% include cc-url for="Texas - Wikipedia" %}), [Louisiana]({% include cc-url for="Louisiana - Wikipedia" %}), [Mississippi]({% include cc-url for="Mississippi - Wikipedia" %}), [Alabama]({% include cc-url for="Alabama - Wikipedia" %}), and [Florida]({% include cc-url for="Florida - Wikipedia" %}), which border the Gulf on the north, are often referred to as the "Third Coast" of the United States (in addition to its Atlantic and Pacific coasts).
