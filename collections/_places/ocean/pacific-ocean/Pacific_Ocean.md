The **Pacific Ocean** is the largest and deepest of [Earth](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth)'s five oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south, and is bounded by the continents of Asia and Oceania in the west and the Americas in the east.
