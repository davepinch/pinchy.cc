The **Skykomish River** is a 29-mile (47 km) long river in the U.S. state of [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)) which drains the west side of the [Cascade Mountains](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Range) in the southeast section of [Snohomish County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snohomish_County,_Washington) and the northeast corner of [King County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_County,_Washington). The river starts with the confluence of the North Fork Skykomish River and South Fork Skykomish River approximately one mile west of Index, then flowing northwesterly towards [Puget Sound](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound). It is joined by the Sultan River and the Wallace River at Sultan. It then meets the Snoqualmie River to form the Snohomish River at Monroe. The Snohomish River continues along the river valley eventually dumping into Port Gardner Bay on Possession Sound (part of Puget Sound).
