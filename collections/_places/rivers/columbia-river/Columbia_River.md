The **Columbia River** (Upper Chinook: *Wimahl* or *Wimal*; Sahaptin: *Nch’i-Wàna* or *Nchi wana*; Sinixt dialect *swah'netk'qhu*) is the largest river in the Pacific Northwest region of [North America]({% include cc-url for="North America - Wikipedia" %}). The river rises in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. It flows northwest and then south into the U.S. state of Washington, then turns west to form most of the border between Washington and the state of Oregon before emptying into the Pacific Ocean. The river is 1,243 miles (2,000 km) long, and its largest tributary is the Snake River. Its drainage basin is roughly the size of France and extends into seven US states and a Canadian province. The fourth-largest river in the United States by volume, the Columbia has the greatest flow of any North American river entering the Pacific. The Columbia has the 36th greatest discharge of any river in the world.
