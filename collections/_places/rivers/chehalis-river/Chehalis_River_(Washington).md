The **Chehalis River** (/ʃəˈheɪlɪs/ shə-HAY-lis) is a river in [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)) in the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). It originates in several forks in southwestern Washington, flows east, then north, then west, in a large curve, before emptying into Grays Harbor, an estuary of the [Pacific Ocean](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean). The river is the largest solely contained drainage basin in the state.
