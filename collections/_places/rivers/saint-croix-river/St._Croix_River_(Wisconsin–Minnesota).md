The **St. Croix River** (/ˈseɪnt ˈkrɔɪ/ SAYNT KROY; literally "holy cross" in French) is a tributary of the [Mississippi River](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River), approximately 169 miles (272 km) long, in the U.S. states of [Wisconsin](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin) and [Minnesota](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota). The lower 125 miles (201 km) of the river form the border between Wisconsin and Minnesota. The river is a National Scenic Riverway under the protection of the National Park Service. A hydroelectric plant at the Saint Croix Falls Dam supplies power to the Minneapolis–St. Paul metropolitan area.
