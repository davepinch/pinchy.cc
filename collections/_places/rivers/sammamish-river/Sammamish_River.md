The **Sammamish River** (also known as **Sammamish Slough**) flows through north [King County](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_County,_Washington), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)) for about 14 miles (23 km), draining [Lake Sammamish](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Sammamish) into [Lake Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Washington). Along its course, the Sammamish River flows through [Redmond](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington), [Woodinville](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodinville,_Washington), [Bothell](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bothell,_Washington), and [Kenmore](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenmore,_Washington).

The river is named after the native people who once lived along its entire length.
