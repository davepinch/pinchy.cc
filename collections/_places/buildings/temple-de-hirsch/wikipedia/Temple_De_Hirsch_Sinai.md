**Temple De Hirsch Sinai** is a Reform Jewish congregation with campuses in [Seattle](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle) and nearby [Bellevue](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue,_Washington), [Washington](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)), [USA](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). It was formed as a 1971 merger between the earlier Temple De Hirsch (Seattle, founded 1899) and Temple Sinai (Bellevue, founded 1961) and is the largest Reform congregation in the [Pacific Northwest](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest). The old Temple De Hirsch building (or Old Sanctuary) was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but was demolished in 1993. Part of the fa√ßade remains.
