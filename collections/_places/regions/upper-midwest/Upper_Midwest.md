The **Upper Midwest** is a region in the northern portion of the U.S. Census Bureau's [Midwestern United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States). It is largely a sub-region of the Midwest. Although the exact boundaries are not uniformly agreed-upon, the region is defined as referring to the states of [Michigan](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan), [Minnesota](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota) and [Wisconsin](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin); some definitions include Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, and parts of Nebraska and Montana as well.
