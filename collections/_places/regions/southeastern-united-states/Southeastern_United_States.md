The **Southeastern United States**, also referred to as the American Southeast, the Southeast, or simply the South, is a geographical region of the [United States](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). It is located broadly on the eastern portion of the Southern United States and the southern portion of the Eastern United States. It comprises at least a core of states on the lower East Coast of the United States and eastern Gulf Coast. Expansively, it reaches as far north as [West Virginia](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia) and [Maryland](Maryland (en.wikipedia.org)), which borders the Ohio River and Masonâ€“Dixon line, and stretches as far west as [Arkansas](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas) and [Louisiana](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana). There is no official U.S. government definition of the region, though various agencies and departments use different definitions.
