PVS believes that all people deserve human contact and they have a mission to visit prisoners in isolation.

PVS needs reliable, empathetic volunteers who can talk with isolated prisoners and follow through on their committment to keep going. This is hard.

Do you know that PVS is the only organization in the United States with permission to visit federal prisoners. This is because they are reliable, and they provide extensive training on maintaining your safety, your anonimity, and your comfort.
