Do not browse dangerous websites, e.g., porn, webcams, piracy, etc. These sites are vectors for malicious software that could install a virus or take control of your machine. If you must visit a dangerous website, do it on a different computer or a virtual machine that has no connection whatsoever to your financial accounts or crypto wallets.
