## Is AI-generated art, art?
When you create a picture using the AI-generated art, it is not so much that you have created the art, but rather you have discovered the art in the grand tree of possibilities return by the model. Even using a purely random number generator, the model has a maximum number of unique images it can output. It is limited its resolution, color depth and other factors that make it unique.
