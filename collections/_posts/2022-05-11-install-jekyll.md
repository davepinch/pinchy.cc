[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) is a static website generator. It reads your markdown files and other content and creates the HTML and CSS files for a website that can be hosted anywhere. Jekyll is written in the Ruby programming language, so you need to install Ruby first and then install Jekyll. 

If you are installing Jekyll for use on GitHub pages (like this blog), you should install the specific versions of Ruby and Jekyll used by GitHub Pages. See [How to check Github Pages dependencies]({% post_url 2022-05-07-check-github-pages-dependencies %}) for instructions. This is not required if you are hosting a blog elsewhere but will minimize some compatibility issues when hosting on GitHub Pages.

Jekyll installation instructions are here:

For Windows users, see [How to install Ruby and Jekyll on Windows]({% post_url 2022-05-07-install-ruby-and-jekyll-on-windows %}).
