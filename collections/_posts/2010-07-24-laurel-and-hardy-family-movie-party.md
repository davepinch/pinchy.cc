From [MPR](https://web.archive.org/web/20221126043321/https://www.mpr.org/stories/2010/06/30/mprmovieparty):

> Minnesota Public Radio presents another installment of its wildly popular "Movie Party" series. Join MPR's Movie Maven Stephanie Curtis, along with A Prairie Home CompanionÂ®'s sound effects man Tom Keith and theater organ master Mike Grandchamp as they create a rich sound-and-music accompaniment to four of Laurel and Hardy's best silent films.
> A super family friendly event, there will be free bowler hats for kids, free popcorn, plus a live slapstick half-time show from theater maker Jon Ferguson and a big finish--bring your dancing shoes!
