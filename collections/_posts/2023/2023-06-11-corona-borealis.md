The sky was clear after a few days of rain and cloudy weather. [Megrez](/megrez/) and [Polaris](/polaris/) were easy to find; [Giausar](/giausar/) was just at the edge of visibility. We spent some time identifying [Boötes](/bootes/) and [Corona Borealis](/corona-borealis/). Mary saw two satellites cross past each other, and later noticed [Cassiopeia](/cassiopeia/) in the northern sky just above the trees.
