**Draining is not safe**

They don't make walkable drains for convenience. Drains are large because they are designed to move huge amounts of water quickly. A drain receives water from a large area, sometimes an entire watershed, meaning even small amounts of precipitation will get concentrated quickly. You will not be able to maintain footing against the water flow, and eventually you will get pushed down the drain, scraping against concrete and exposed pipes and rebar. Even if you survive that, you must still fight off drowning and hypothermia.

**Abandoned buildings are not safe**

Abandoned buildings are often stripped down and partially deconstructed -- exposing elevator shafts, holes in the floor, asbestos, exposed chemicals, unprotected electrical wires, etc. Abandoned buildings are by definition not maintained, so structures like steel stairwells may be sufficiently eroded to collapse while your group is climbing on them.

## Planning
* Scope out the area ahead of time in daylight.
* Know your legal rights and have a plan in case you get arrested.
* Don't cause unnecessary attention with expired car tabs, illegal parking, etc.
* If draining, check the weather continuously and confirm absolutely no chance of any precipitation.
* Get connected to the local urban exploration community. They know more than you.
* Ensure an outside party knows your whereabouts and exploration plan in case rescue is needed.

## Supplies
* Footware (e.g., steel-toed boots)
* First-aid kit with disinfectant
* Flashlights (LED or waterproof)
* Gloves
* Water resistent mobile phone.

## Entry
* Stay quiet.
* Keep flashlights pointed down.
* Never carry tools that may be interpreted as buglary tools, e.g., hammers.
* Wear dark clothing.

## Drains
* Abort immediately if waterflow or airflow changes in any way (volume, garbage, speed, wind, etc.).
* Pay attention to potential exit spots and shelters.
* Get up to date on your spiritual requirements. If water starts flowing, you will die painfully.
* Remove embarassing postings from your social media. If you die, you will be mocked relentlessly.
