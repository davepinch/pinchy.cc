Based on the [home page on October 28, 2023](https://web.archive.org/web/20231028234746/https://pinchy.cc/index.html), I started at the [Salt Creek Recreation Area](/salt-creek-recreation-area).

The page is missing a link to the corresponding Wikipedia article. To fix, I added the hashtag property `salt-creek-recreation-area` to the page front matter (this will not be required in the future).

With no direct link, I manually navigated to the page at [/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Creek_Recreation_Area](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Creek_Recreation_Area).

I have some history with Port Angeles.

Port Angeles borders the Strait of Juan de Fuco, which is a reflection of the geological history of the region. In hindsight perhaps the Olympic mountains would have gotten closer to Jasper, but decision made:

* Added [Straight of Juan de Fuco](/strait-of-juan-de-fuca/)
* Added [Straight of Juan de Fuco (en.wikipedia.org)](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Juan_de_Fuca)
* Archived the [Wikipedia article](https://web.archive.org/web/20231029005549/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Juan_de_Fuca).

The Wikipedia article doesn't say much about the geology of the region. Try the Salish Sea.

* Added [Salish Sea (en.wikipedia.org)](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salish_Sea)
* Added [Georgia Depression](/georgia-depression/)

* Updated [Vashon Glaciation](/vashon-glaciation/)
* Updated [Vashon Glaciation (en.wikipedia.org)](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vashon_Glaciation)

The Vashon content doesn't have much geology, backing up to the Georgia Depression, which mentions "[The majority of soils in the [Georgia] depression are formed from glacial till, glacial outwash, and Lacustrine deposits.](/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Depression-snippet-geology-1-2)".
