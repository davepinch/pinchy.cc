## Planning
* Scope out the area ahead of time in daylight.
* Know your legal rights and have a plan in case you get arrested.
* Don't cause unnecessary attention with expired car tabs, etc.

## Supplies
* Footware (e.g., steel-toed boots)
* First-aid kit with disinfectant
* Flashlights (LED or waterproof)

## Entry
* Stay quiet.
* Keep flashlights pointed down when others might see you.

## Drains
* Abort immediately if waterflow changes in any way (volume, garbage, speed, etc.).
* Pay attention to potential exit spots and shelters.
