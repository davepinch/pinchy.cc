A colorful piece of construction covering the sidewalk in the High Point neighborhood of [West Seattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Seattle). At the time I was canvassing for a political candidate and it was my first time in the neighborhood.

![A large piece of metal covering construction on the sidewalk. The metal was painted bright yellow but has been heavily worn causing an interesting mix of yellow and black splotches. A red leaf on the board provides some color contrast.](/assets/images/2019/2019-11-05-brightly-worn-sidewalk-smaller.jpg)
