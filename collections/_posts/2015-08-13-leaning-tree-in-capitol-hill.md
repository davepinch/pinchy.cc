I liked the appearance of this oddly curved tree with an old RV in the background. The tree was cut down some time ago although as of March 2022 it is still possible to see the tree on Bing street view. The location is [15th Avenue and E. Olive Street](https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=3795ba56-7f54-47b0-8a16-7314e20104ec&cp=47.616444~-122.312817&lvl=19&dir=321.20486&pi=8.129562&style=x&mo=z.0&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027).

![A tree is tightly curved downward like an upside-down J. In the background is a house and silver RV, and in front a man is walking on the sidewalk.](/assets/images/2015/2015-08-13-leaning-tree-in-capitol-hill.jpg)
