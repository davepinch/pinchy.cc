A large fish floating stationary in the air as heavy winds blew over it.

It was stable, and after pausing started moving forward again smoothly against the win.

I called out to Mary, "Look, a puffer fish!"

As we watched it turned into the weight of a pendulum. It was not a real fish.

The pendulum reached its apex and hit another fish, exploding into a brilliant interconnected parts before coming back together.

Mary and I noticed the crowd had changed. There was something strange going on.

The fish was real.

I began trying to get my camera but I could not figure out my backpack.
