## Save in the drafts folder

* Posts in the *_drafts* folder are not published to the site.
* The post does not need a date prefix.
* You can [preview drafts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#drafts) by running jekyll serve or jekyll build with the --drafts switch. They will be ordered with posts based on last modification date.

## Set published to false

Set *published* to false in the [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) of the post.
