## Set-builder notation tester

* The set is visualized as a sequences of boxes that flow from left to right, and then from top to bottom, wrapping when the margin is reached. Each item has an integer as a label, starting with 0 for the first item and then incrementing with each subsequent item.

* Below the set is a text box where set-builder notation can be written. If a valid expression is entered, then any matching integers in the set are highlighted.

## Decision Matrix

* This matrix can help you choose an item from a list.
* First add a row for each item in the list.
* Then add a column for each factor that is important to you, e.g., low price, easy to use, etc.
* For each factor, rate its importance on a scale of 1 to 10. Higher numbers arae more important.

With the matrix now complete, you can begin rating each item in the list. For each item, you will consider each factor and rate the item on a scale of 1 to 10. For best results, when rating an item agaainst a factor, do not consider any other factors. Rate each factor independently.

### Front Matter

A template can be defined in front-matter as follows:

decision-matrix:
  title: "Decide between careers"
  items:
    - title: "Software Developer"
    - title: "Machine Learning Specialist"
  factors:
    - title: "Job Skills"
    - title: "Duties and Responsibilities"
    - title: "Coworker Interactions"
    - title: "Market Size"
    - title: "10 Year Outlook"
    - title: "Characteristics of people doing it today"
  ratings:
    - item: "Software Developer"
      factor: "Job SKills"
      rating: 7
  resources:
    - [decision-matrix](/decision-matrix/)

Each cell may contain a text and/or numeric value.
Columns are sortable.
Cells are rendered with various styles to indicate its score and position.
Total word count is shown to help ensure the printed output stays within a word limit.
The matrix can be saved to local storage.

## Math Footer

Put a link in the footer with a random addition (but do not show solution).  For example:

[27+95](/27-plus-95/)

Use a big masthead on the target page. Look into best way to generate the pages. One option is to use PowerShell. Might be possible
