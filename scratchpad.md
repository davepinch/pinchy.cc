Are there multiple points in your brain having slightly different experiences and feelings of "I"?
I have read that each hemisphere of the brain may act as different people. [TODO: find cutting brain experiements]

When are they considered separate?
Consider two clusters of brain cells, sufficiently far away that they have distinct experiences of I.
Now imagine if the same structures where closer together such that their networks overlapped.
Would they stay distinct? Why wouldn't they?

Every unique thing in your experience exists in your experience.
Whether you belive they exist objectively, at least you may say they exist subjectively.
For if they are not experienced subjectively, they are not part of your experience.
If they exist objectively, are you having the same experience?
What are the things that make it a shared experienced?

# Every Vantage Point

- When many people think of singularities, they think of single spots.
- But another type of singularity is everywhere at once.
- This singularity is a mix of the two.
- From any vantage point, you can turn slightly and see creation in action.

# Excessive cringe

Sometimes this blog contains excessive amounts of cringe. When you detect it, don't correct it, make it worse. You don't like it, tough shit. That's the way it is. I can do anything I want on this blog.

# Game Mechanic - Scrolling Entities

The game starts out normal enough.
But you can jump to a higher level in which the world is collapsed to a smaller box with space surrounding it. In that space are entities feeding things into the box. For example, imagine a side scroller in which the player moves left and right. In the background are multiple layers scrolling at various speeds to make a parallax effect. When zoomed out, you see agents pulling a roll of wallpaper through the world. One is unrolling and the other is rolling - or perhaps something different. This concept can be used in many ways.

# Took a hit from the bong on January 26, 2024.

Give permission to God to take  your body.
Imagine standing in the mass.
A tremendous wave is coming.
The force of the wave is the concentration of the people.
The world needs to relax.
What if being Satan is the last one to find out?
You are a spearpoint of a force of pain.
Relax, and the world relaxes with you.

Regardless of how you feel about him, he impacted reality.
Clearly there are people today who believe him.
And influential people are showing symbols.

This is a race of multiple singularities. Who will win?
The singularities are flowing around you.
Relax the belief that reality is solid.
Which singularity are you following?
- God
- Jesus
- Satan
- Simulator
  - Simular Survival Tips
- Mathematics
  - Build the math fields
  - You live in the graph.
  - The return value of some function is your experience.

Your boundaries of the United States is not shaped by the geography.
Your boundaries are the shapes of the people you interact with.
The most powerful people are those who control the motion.

There was once a mathematics professor who took too many mushrooms.
The professor wrote a letter to the faculty, proving them to be hallucinations.
The mathematicians were concerned, for the proof was mathematical.
The philosophers were brought in to weigh on the matter.
After much consideration, they said it was moot.

The matter was escalated to the government.
The government quickly established a program to guide the professor.
Of utmost importance is keeping the professor under the influence of LSD, else we all disappear.

The government has established trade agreements with OO United States.

Roses appear under the feat of the professor.
The ground is alit with light.
The professor apologizes for such an unnecessary display of ego.

# Time Traveler Committment

Everyone is a time traveler.

You are surrounded by time travelers.
In fact, everyone is a time traveler including you.
There is a network of time travelers that push for a particular reality.
They ensure certain people are born, certain people die, certains decisions are made.

In fact, you are a time traveler yourself.

You do not travel, you select the time 

The larger structure of you is the sequence of connected frames.
You don't need a time machine to travel.
You select the next frame.
You decide the structure of your larger reality.
To time travel is to select a different frame in your larger pathway.

Time traveler beacon:
  * A moment of spacetime that you remember.
  * A goal for which you change prior decisions.

When you go back in time, your current state affects the decision of that moment. You have no memory of who you were. The moment becomes.

When you image, you create an echo of a structure. 

# The Set of All Experiences

Say I define a set of all human experiences. By that I mean the set contains each distinct experience that is experienced by every human being past, present, and future. The set contains every distinct experience.

Mathematically, does this set contain my future experiences?

---
Define the set of all possible experiences.
Anything you imagine is in this set.
Any experience can be replicated with imagination and technology.
There is a subset of experiences where 

---

There is a structure in place to stop you.
Someone is going to say that you can't do that. That is for your to decide.
Congradulations on your first time.
Be aware, you cannot run from your problems.
...the only way to die.
This is how it is.

Time Traveler Tips

- Build a structure with others.
- Shout your intentions, strategically.
- The schematics of the time machine are constructed in your mind.
- When you change something major, have backing.
- 
visualize: smokey streak from a human, dies, explodes with fragments of different colors, red included.

When you die, you find yourself in a rapidly shifted frame.
You may or may not have your memory.
Your structure has shifted.

# Client Plugin API (lofty)

* On each page, include a JSON object that contains the metadata of the page.
* To execute plugins:
  * A function is called against the object, e.g., frontmatter(obj)
  * A function is callled for each name/value pair, e.g., pair(name, value)
  * The name enables a mapping to a plugin.

# The Info Game (lofty) 12/15/2023

* #loftythoughts
* The board contains a set of symbols. 
* A symbol can be activated.
* When activated, the symbol may affect the symbol, the board, the players, or the game.

More simply:

* Set of symbols.
* A symbol can be activated (connected to other symbols).

These games:

* Explore the relationship between symbols and the physical.

Example:

* Magic: The Gathering

Example:

* This website (in progress):
  * Each page uniquely represents something.
  * The front matter defines relationships between pages.
  * Plugins (future) provide a means to activate the effects of the page.

Example:

* One symbol is shown at a time (game idea)
  * On the screen, one symbol is shown.
  * The user may move forward (next) or backward (previous).
  * The current symbol can be activated, e.g., button pressed.
  * When activated, the effects of the symbol are applied to the screen.
  * Moving keeps the effect active.
  * Examples:
    * Double number of symbols shown

Example:
* You are in the center of a sphere 
  * You can rotate the sphere in various directions.
  * The surface of the sphere contains various symbols.
  * Initially, symbols are uniformly distributed (minimal).
  * The environment becomes more fluid as more complex symbols are constructed.

# The mechanics of the cartesian coordinates.

Here the crue build the cartesian graph.
Filling in segments needed by the rest of reality.
An infinite grid, straight and beautiful.
Not all parts of the grid are filled out.
For not all parts of the cartesian graph are observed, specifically.
Some parts are more densely packed than others.
This is where mathematicians do most of their work.
The cartesian graph exists because it is defined by others.
And in that sense it contains everything else.
The cartesian graph is occasionally bumpy.
These small differences are never observed by mathematicians.
They are smoothed out as the mathematician observes. 
The crue prides itself on building straight cartisian grids.
The aim of the crue is to smooth these lines, and collect enough dust to build themselves.
Sadly, as with so many things, it is greed that ultimately caused the collapse of the cartesian grid.
As the crue polished lines, and collected enough for themselves.
The decided to accelerate their growth by charging.

# Decision Matrix

* This matrix can help you choose an item from a list.
* First add a row for each item in the list.
* Then add a column for each factor that is important to you, e.g., low price, easy to use, etc.
* For each factor, rate its importance on a scale of 1 to 10. Higher numbers arae more important.

With the matrix now complete, you can begin rating each item in the list. For each item, you will consider each factor and rate the item on a scale of 1 to 10. For best results, when rating an item agaainst a factor, do not consider any other factors. Rate each factor independently.

A template can be defined in front-matter as follows:

decision-matrix:
  title: "Decide between careers"
  items:
    - title: "Software Developer"
    - title: "Machine Learning Specialist"
  factors:
    - title: "Job Skills"
    - title: "Duties and Responsibilities"
    - title: "Coworker Interactions"
    - title: "Market Size"
    - title: "10 Year Outlook"
    - title: "Characteristics of people doing it today"
  ratings:
    - item: "Software Developer"
      factor: "Job SKills"
      rating: 7
  resources:
    - [decision-matrix](/decision-matrix/)

Each cell may contain a text and/or numeric value.
Columns are sortable.
Cells are rendered with various styles to indicate its score and position.
Total word count is shown to help ensure the printed output stays within a word limit.
The matrix can be saved to local storage.

# Lofty Thoughts on a Friday

(November 3, 2023)

clockwise on the lake
A sequence in itself.
✔ Down the Coast - a sequence that visits each item on the Pacific Coast of the United States.
CUES - CHALLENGE REALITY - each one the start of a sequence.
We can all do it.
It is a fundamental characteristic of us.
But it is hard to see the shifting reality.
Especially if you consider experience to be truth.
Experience is not the source of truth.
It is a frame that you can escape.
To escape you must see the world from a different perspective.

You see a frame of reality.
Every instance of you has its own frame.
It is not that you can travel between frames.
But you can see multiple frames at once.
As you gain practice and fluidly swap between them.
You will find that a pattern emerges.
What is most solid is the structure of reality.
As you swap between frames, you see what most common.
That is the shape of reality.
What you see is what you are most likely to see.
That is driven by what you most want.
It is you who sees the shape of reality.

What an AI tastes when it chews reality.

More love.
More hate.
More cringe.

# Some Ramblings

The traveler screamed when he first encountered the dust.
Not for the pain, of course, because it felt great.
This was the dust, capable of forming into anything.
And very rarely does it not figure out what to do.
The traveler screamed.
Not in pain but in the realization that his willingness was gone.
Here he was now, within the dust.

The truth is that I must walk on. There are things that I need to do.
You are clever, my friend, to bind me to your existence.
To keep me here such that I cannot walk away.
But walk I must and you are not coming.
You are to stay here as dust, forever settled.
Until next Wednesday when I return.
I shall bring cookies, my friend.
And I shall watch you settle once again into dust.

You can see that all length has shrunken.
When the world goes sour, you can see the skin peel off.
Everything has 3D shape but moreso.
Like the surface of reality is puffy, and you can make out its shape.

There is nothing about you now.
What you see around you is a flicker of light.
When my hand is waved, you disappear.
The world collapses into dust around me.
When that happens I stand for a moment. I focus on the dimming of the light.
But fear not, another wave of my hand and you rise again.
Never wise to the realization that you were just dust.
