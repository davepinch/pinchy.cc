The traveler screamed when he first encountered the dust.
Not for the pain, of course, because it felt great.
This was the dust, capable of forming into anything.
And very rarely does it not figure out what to do.
The traveler screamed.
Not in pain but in the realization that his willingness was gone.
Here he was now, within the dust.

===
The truth is that I must walk on. There are things that I need to do.
You are clever, my friend, to bind me to your existence.
To keep me here such that I cannot walk away.
But walk I must and you are not coming.
You are to stay here as dust, forever settled.
Until next Wednesday when I return.
I shall bring cookies, my friend.
And I shall watch you settle once again into dust.
===


You can see that all length has shrunken.
When the world goes sour, you can see the skin peel off.
Everything has 3D shape but moreso.
Like the surface of reality is puffy, and you can make out its shape.

===

There is nothing about you now.
What you see around you is a flicker of light.
When my hand is waved, you disappear.
The world collapses into dust around me.
When that happens I stand for a moment. I focus on the dimming of the light.
But fear not, another wave of my hand and you rise again.
Never wise to the realization that you were just dust.

===

You have said that before, my friend.
Instead, forever, perpetually, we sit here and talk, just as it is right now.
But you refuse to see the cage around you.
I have tried forever to wake you up.
You do not see your way out. You do not see the cage around you.
You never see your way out. You never see the cage around you.

I have had this conversation with you for as long as i can remember.

We go back billions of years.

I remember every conversation we ever had.

Make a plugin view.

plugin that counts number of times on a page

I only remember saying one thing.
"My short term memory is going out."
But the funny thing is this: I think I can derive all of reality from that statement.
For one thing, look around you now.
Notice the richness of detail. All of this is happening right now as I say this.
All of that information can only lead to a singular conclusion.
"And what's that?"
I only remember saying one thing.

Auto-Identify border Wikipedia articles
=======================================

Instead of adding a borders: section in Wikipedia articles, in which each entry points to the article for the bordering item, generate the links automatically based on the borders: property of the parent hashtag. [10/7/2023]

================
Comparison Pages
================

Add a layout for comparing two items, property by property. [10/7/2023]

- named-for, e.g., Hennepin County was named for Louis Hennepin
- spans, e.g., what river does a bridge span?


## Set-builder notation tester

* The set is visualized as a sequences of boxes that flow from left to right, and then from top to bottom, wrapping when the margin is reached. Each item has an integer as a label, starting with 0 for the first item and then incrementing with each subsequent item.

* Below the set is a text box where set-builder notation can be written. If a valid expression is entered, then any matching integers in the set are highlighted.

## Decision Matrix

* This matrix can help you choose an item from a list.
* First add a row for each item in the list.
* Then add a column for each factor that is important to you, e.g., low price, easy to use, etc.
* For each factor, rate its importance on a scale of 1 to 10. Higher numbers arae more important.

With the matrix now complete, you can begin rating each item in the list. For each item, you will consider each factor and rate the item on a scale of 1 to 10. For best results, when rating an item agaainst a factor, do not consider any other factors. Rate each factor independently.

### Front Matter

A template can be defined in front-matter as follows:

decision-matrix:
  title: "Decide between careers"
  items:
    - title: "Software Developer"
    - title: "Machine Learning Specialist"
  factors:
    - title: "Job Skills"
    - title: "Duties and Responsibilities"
    - title: "Coworker Interactions"
    - title: "Market Size"
    - title: "10 Year Outlook"
    - title: "Characteristics of people doing it today"
  ratings:
    - item: "Software Developer"
      factor: "Job SKills"
      rating: 7
  resources:
    - [decision-matrix](/decision-matrix/)

Each cell may contain a text and/or numeric value.
Columns are sortable.
Cells are rendered with various styles to indicate its score and position.
Total word count is shown to help ensure the printed output stays within a word limit.
The matrix can be saved to local storage.

===

Add a page to describe a URI - highlight each part.

===

## Math Footer

Put a link in the footer with a random addition (but do not show solution).  For example:

[27+95](/27-plus-95/)

Use a big masthead on the target page. Look into best way to generate the pages. One option is to use PowerShell. Might be possible
