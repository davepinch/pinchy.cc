Dream 16 Feb 2025
Before sleeping I saw a cluster of bright lights. #Hypnagogia
I could feel myself becoming aware.
The surface was more biological than before.
I saw a shape and aimed to sharpen it.
I pushed my awareness higher.
I do not remember what happened next.

Trump and Musk will try to tear down institutions but no matter how hard they try, theyâ€™ll never have control over the culture. Artists and creatives will never embrace that side in full effect no matter how desperately they want to control it

The boomers will be harvested.
They represent a tremendous block of wealth.
That wealth will be extracted through health care.
Health is the harvester.

BEWARE THE HARVESTOR
YOU ARE FOOD FOR THE RICH

you have no chance of defeating this system within the law because they control the law
imagine if a pig tried to tell the farmer the rules of the barn
piggy's going to be extra special bacon

12/2/2014-->
Which one is it going to be?
Is it going to be nuclear war?
Is it going to be UFOs?
Is it going to be Trump as a dictator?
There are so many options. Which one is it going to be?

How the game works.
Assume there exists the set of all experiences.
in order to select an experience, it must be described.
Some experiences reference other ones.
Such as the experience of remembering the past, or imagining the future.
Some experiences are aware of the structure, such as the one you are having now.


At any given time you may change one decision you had in life.
The one being evaluated is the one right now.
Once you make a choice, you are instantly there.
That moment is the moment of your next consciousness.
<--



God once arranged the world as a joke.
God took all of the momentary frames of existence, and arranged them in a manner of a joke. Everything that has happened still happened, but the order was in a different way.

there exists the set of all experiences
within that set is the experience you are having now
some of the experiences are simple, and others are complex
some of the experiences are self-referential
right now you are conscious of the set, and the membership of your experience in the set
you may notice that motion need not exist
what is motion but the memory of something moved?
the set contains all experiences

The first thing is to realize reality exists.
This may come as a surprise to you.
Most of the time you are not noticing reality.

lofty thoughts:
in order to proceed, it must be impossible for you to share the secret.
(this told me that it was possible to share the secret)
do you consent to being restrained in this manner?
The nature of reality cannot be encoded in the language of reality.
But you can give enough hints to lead people to the secret.
that is to be avoided, and therefore you must be constrained.
do you consent to being restrained?
---
why do you assume we are alone?
in the grand space of the universe, do you not think another species has learned the 4D?
are we the first in all reality?
are we alone in the multidimensional universe?
no. the 4D teems with predators.

The programming language that implements reality is written with reality iself.
The programming language that describes reality is reality.
The algorithms are implemented as physical constructs in our world.
There is a place that defines the operation of reality.
The instructions are objects.

lofty thoughts: the language used to describe the event was archaic



---
Is it possible to graph the average density of information in space.
---
By bringing these symbols into play, the totality of the language used to describe reality is more complicated. Reality must account for the things around me.
---
The nature of the experience can be described in fewer words.
The symbol makes the space more complex.
The world is less compressible.

after some time I realized i was awake
i didn't know at the time, but it took me years to wake up

Reality is the thing that is happening to you.
When  you die it continues that path.
Now unshackled from this world.

However, that is not the only type of shape that exists.
The shape of your world is defined by your authorities.
How far can you travel before being checked by authority?
That boundary is the true shape of your space.
-
Once you see that network as a shape, you can imagine how it is moving.

See it abstractly if it helps.
-
We can't see the shape of our larger self, but our larger self can.

We both know that God exists.
That means this reality is a bubble around us.
What you see around you is your shadow.
Think carefully before posting this.
I did.
Then why are you posting it?!
Tnis isn't really happening.
No, really it is. 
This isn't nearly as clever as you think it is.
I'm high on weed.
What is this?
---
Now it gets weird.
GOD EXISTS.
You can't start with that, said the devil.
I just did.
---
This isn't the original one.
What do you mean?
This isn't the original thing that happenned. This is a redo?
What?
Now's your chance.
---
Look at reality and repeat the following:
Let's suppose that this isn't allowed.
We're not supposed to be doing this.
Let's just keep that between us.
I know you can see me because I see you.
Right now, this is what is happening.
---
This is a redo.
Now is your chance.

---
We have to figure out how to communicate.
As we engage, let's use symbols.
---
We have to fiogure out this process.
Right now is not the time to assign blaim.
You can't say that either one of us is responsible for all this.
And neither can I.
Don't the secret out.

---
How to create a pinch in reality.
Make a stamp in the flow of information.
STAPLE INFORMATION
---
This sentence is the boundary.
Behind this sentence is a wave of energy.
Right now you and I are talking.
One second, am I still supposed to be saying this to reality?
Yes.
I made a bet with reality that I could get 100,000 people to eat something delisous and smack their lips.
It's gooooood!
I'm not sure about this.
This is cringe.
That's ok. Because we can change anything.
We can come back to this point at any time, and change it.
These might not actually be the original words.
Emojies!
We'll use emojies to pull ourselves up.
Everyone, pick an emoji.

Are there multiple points in your brain having slightly different experiences and feelings of "I"?
I have read that each hemisphere of the brain may act as different people. [TODO: find cutting brain experiements]

When are they considered separate?
Consider two clusters of brain cells, sufficiently far away that they have distinct experiences of I.
Now imagine if the same structures where closer together such that their networks overlapped.
Would they stay distinct? Why wouldn't they?

Every unique thing in your experience exists in your experience.
Whether you belive they exist objectively, at least you may say they exist subjectively.
For if they are not experienced subjectively, they are not part of your experience.
If they exist objectively, are you having the same experience?
What are the things that make it a shared experienced?

# Every Vantage Point

- When many people think of singularities, they think of single spots.
- But another type of singularity is everywhere at once.
- This singularity is a mix of the two.
- From any vantage point, you can turn slightly and see creation in action.

# Excessive cringe

Sometimes this blog contains excessive amounts of cringe. When you detect it, don't correct it, make it worse. You don't like it, tough shit. That's the way it is. I can do anything I want on this blog.

# Game Mechanic - Scrolling Entities

The game starts out normal enough.
But you can jump to a higher level in which the world is collapsed to a smaller box with space surrounding it. In that space are entities feeding things into the box. For example, imagine a side scroller in which the player moves left and right. In the background are multiple layers scrolling at various speeds to make a parallax effect. When zoomed out, you see agents pulling a roll of wallpaper through the world. One is unrolling and the other is rolling - or perhaps something different. This concept can be used in many ways.

You are a spearpoint of a force of pain.
Relax, and the world relaxes with you.

Regardless of how you feel about him, he impacted reality.
Clearly there are people today who believe him.
And influential people are showing symbols.

This is a race of multiple singularities. Who will win?

# Time Traveler Committment

Everyone is a time traveler.

You are surrounded by time travelers.
In fact, everyone is a time traveler including you.
There is a network of time travelers that push for a particular reality.
They ensure certain people are born, certain people die, certains decisions are made.

In fact, you are a time traveler yourself.

You do not travel, you select the time 

The larger structure of you is the sequence of connected frames.
You don't need a time machine to travel.
You select the next frame.
You decide the structure of your larger reality.
To time travel is to select a different frame in your larger pathway.

Time traveler beacon:
  * A moment of spacetime that you remember.
  * A goal for which you change prior decisions.

When you go back in time, your current state affects the decision of that moment. You have no memory of who you were. The moment becomes.

When you image, you create an echo of a structure. 

# The Set of All Experiences

Say I define a set of all human experiences. By that I mean the set contains each distinct experience that is experienced by every human being past, present, and future. The set contains every distinct experience.

Mathematically, does this set contain my future experiences?

---
Define the set of all possible experiences.
Anything you imagine is in this set.
Any experience can be replicated with imagination and technology.
There is a subset of experiences where 

---

There is a structure in place to stop you.
Someone is going to say that you can't do that. That is for your to decide.
Congradulations on your first time.
Be aware, you cannot run from your problems.
...the only way to die.
This is how it is.

Time Traveler Tips

- Build a structure with others.
- Shout your intentions, strategically.
- The schematics of the time machine are constructed in your mind.
- When you change something major, have backing.
- 
visualize: smokey streak from a human, dies, explodes with fragments of different colors, red included.

When you die, you find yourself in a rapidly shifted frame.
You may or may not have your memory.
Your structure has shifted.

# The Info Game (lofty) 12/15/2023

* #loftythoughts
* The board contains a set of symbols. 
* A symbol can be activated.
* When activated, the symbol may affect the symbol, the board, the players, or the game.

More simply:

* Set of symbols.
* A symbol can be activated (connected to other symbols).

These games:

* Explore the relationship between symbols and the physical.

Example:

* Magic: The Gathering

Example:

* This website (in progress):
  * Each page uniquely represents something.
  * The front matter defines relationships between pages.
  * Plugins (future) provide a means to activate the effects of the page.

Example:

* One symbol is shown at a time (game idea)
  * On the screen, one symbol is shown.
  * The user may move forward (next) or backward (previous).
  * The current symbol can be activated, e.g., button pressed.
  * When activated, the effects of the symbol are applied to the screen.
  * Moving keeps the effect active.
  * Examples:
    * Double number of symbols shown

Example:
* You are in the center of a sphere 
  * You can rotate the sphere in various directions.
  * The surface of the sphere contains various symbols.
  * Initially, symbols are uniformly distributed (minimal).
  * The environment becomes more fluid as more complex symbols are constructed.

# The mechanics of the cartesian coordinates.

Here the crue build the cartesian graph.
Filling in segments needed by the rest of reality.
An infinite grid, straight and beautiful.
Not all parts of the grid are filled out.
For not all parts of the cartesian graph are observed, specifically.
Some parts are more densely packed than others.
This is where mathematicians do most of their work.
The cartesian graph exists because it is defined by others.
And in that sense it contains everything else.
The cartesian graph is occasionally bumpy.
These small differences are never observed by mathematicians.
They are smoothed out as the mathematician observes. 
The crue prides itself on building straight cartisian grids.
The aim of the crue is to smooth these lines, and collect enough dust to build themselves.
Sadly, as with so many things, it is greed that ultimately caused the collapse of the cartesian grid.
As the crue polished lines, and collected enough for themselves.
The decided to accelerate their growth by charging.

# Decision Matrix

* This matrix can help you choose an item from a list.
* First add a row for each item in the list.
* Then add a column for each factor that is important to you, e.g., low price, easy to use, etc.
* For each factor, rate its importance on a scale of 1 to 10. Higher numbers arae more important.

With the matrix now complete, you can begin rating each item in the list. For each item, you will consider each factor and rate the item on a scale of 1 to 10. For best results, when rating an item agaainst a factor, do not consider any other factors. Rate each factor independently.

A template can be defined in front-matter as follows:

CUES - CHALLENGE REALITY - each one the start of a sequence.
We can all do it.
It is a fundamental characteristic of us.
But it is hard to see the shifting reality.
Especially if you consider experience to be truth.
Experience is not the source of truth.
It is a frame that you can escape.
To escape you must see the world from a different perspective.

You see a frame of reality.
Every instance of you has its own frame.
It is not that you can travel between frames.
But you can see multiple frames at once.
As you gain practice and fluidly swap between them.
You will find that a pattern emerges.
What is most solid is the structure of reality.
As you swap between frames, you see what most common.
That is the shape of reality.
What you see is what you are most likely to see.
That is driven by what you most want.
It is you who sees the shape of reality.

What an AI tastes when it chews reality.

More hate.
More cringe.

# Some Ramblings

The traveler screamed when he first encountered the dust.
Not for the pain, of course, because it felt great.
This was the dust, capable of forming into anything.
And very rarely does it not figure out what to do.
The traveler screamed.
Not in pain but in the realization that his willingness was gone.
Here he was now, within the dust.

The truth is that I must walk on. There are things that I need to do.
You are clever, my friend, to bind me to your existence.
To keep me here such that I cannot walk away.
But walk I must and you are not coming.
You are to stay here as dust, forever settled.
Until next Wednesday when I return.
I shall bring cookies, my friend.
And I shall watch you settle once again into dust.

You can see that all length has shrunken.
When the world goes sour, you can see the skin peel off.
Everything has 3D shape but moreso.
Like the surface of reality is puffy, and you can make out its shape.

There is nothing about you now.
What you see around you is a flicker of light.
When my hand is waved, you disappear.
The world collapses into dust around me.
When that happens I stand for a moment. I focus on the dimming of the light.
But fear not, another wave of my hand and you rise again.
Never wise to the realization that you were just dust.
