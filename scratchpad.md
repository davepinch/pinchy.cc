# title: "Exploring AI-art universe"
When using a new technique, you are exploring an area of the tree that few others have discovered. A person who limits themself to the presented options, using only images found on the internet, that person has limited themselves to a particular branch of the tree.

# Math Footer

Put a link in the footer with a random addition (but do not show solution).  For example:

[27+95](/27-plus-95/)

# Plugins

Make a plugin view.
- plugin that counts number of times on a page
- plugin to hide a topic
- plugin for tasks
- plugin to hide The Advertisement

# PVS

PVS believes that all people deserve human contact and they have a mission to visit prisoners in isolation. PVS needs reliable, empathetic volunteers who can talk with isolated prisoners and follow through on their committment to keep going. This is hard. Do you know that PVS is the only organization in the United States with permission to visit federal prisoners. This is because they are reliable, and they provide extensive training on maintaining your safety, your anonimity, and your comfort.

# Set-builder notation tester

* The set is visualized as a sequences of boxes that flow from left to right, and then from top to bottom, wrapping when the margin is reached. Each item has an integer as a label, starting with 0 for the first item and then incrementing with each subsequent item.

* Below the set is a text box where set-builder notation can be written. If a valid expression is entered, then any matching integers in the set are highlighted.

# Text Visuals Game

title: "Text visuals game idea"
date: 2023-09-20
published: false

* PowerShell Script, but look at bash.
* Press some characters.
* Different thanks happen as the window is scrolled, e.g., text-based fire.
* Consider a Visual Studio Extension that writes the terminal window or a separate tool window.
* Provides a distraction while waiting for compilation to finish.
* Make sure it doesn't use too much CPU.

# Achievements

When certain conditions are met, e.g., visited each page on I-5, then record an achievement.
Just for fun, paying homage to XBox achievements.

# Auto-Identify border Wikipedia articles

Instead of adding a borders: section in Wikipedia articles, in which each entry points to the article for the bordering item, generate the links automatically based on the borders: property of the parent [10/7/2023]

# Comparison Pages

Add a layout for comparing two items, property by property. [10/7/2023]

# Decision Matrix

* This matrix can help you choose an item from a list.
* First add a row for each item in the list.
* Then add a column for each factor that is important to you, e.g., low price, easy to use, etc.
* For each factor, rate its importance on a scale of 1 to 10. Higher numbers arae more important.

With the matrix now complete, you can begin rating each item in the list. For each item, you will consider each factor and rate the item on a scale of 1 to 10. For best results, when rating an item agaainst a factor, do not consider any other factors. Rate each factor independently.

A template can be defined in front-matter as follows:

decision-matrix:
  title: "Decide between careers"
  items:
    - title: "Software Developer"
    - title: "Machine Learning Specialist"
  factors:
    - title: "Job Skills"
    - title: "Duties and Responsibilities"
    - title: "Coworker Interactions"
    - title: "Market Size"
    - title: "10 Year Outlook"
    - title: "Characteristics of people doing it today"
  ratings:
    - item: "Software Developer"
      factor: "Job SKills"
      rating: 7
  resources:
    - [decision-matrix](/decision-matrix/)

Each cell may contain a text and/or numeric value.
Columns are sortable.
Cells are rendered with various styles to indicate its score and position.
Total word count is shown to help ensure the printed output stays within a word limit.
The matrix can be saved to local storage.

# Latest Page

Whatever the last change is, set it to /latest/

# Lofty Thoughts on a Friday

(November 3, 2023)

clockwise on the lake
A sequence in itself.
✔ Down the Coast - a sequence that visits each item on the Pacific Coast of the United States.
CUES - CHALLENGE REALITY - each one the start of a sequence.
We can all do it.
It is a fundamental characteristic of us.
But it is hard to see the shifting reality.
Especially if you consider experience to be truth.
Experience is not the source of truth.
It is a frame that you can escape.
To escape you must see the world from a different perspective.

You see a frame of reality.
Every instance of you has its own frame.
It is not that you can travel between frames.
But you can see multiple frames at once.
As you gain practice and fluidly swap between them.
You will find that a pattern emerges.
What is most solid is the structure of reality.
As you swap between frames, you see what most common.
That is the shape of reality.
What you see is what you are most likely to see.
That is driven by what you most want.
It is you who sees the shape of reality.

What an AI tastes when it chews reality.

More love.
More hate.
More cringe.

# Some Ramblings

The traveler screamed when he first encountered the dust.
Not for the pain, of course, because it felt great.
This was the dust, capable of forming into anything.
And very rarely does it not figure out what to do.
The traveler screamed.
Not in pain but in the realization that his willingness was gone.
Here he was now, within the dust.

The truth is that I must walk on. There are things that I need to do.
You are clever, my friend, to bind me to your existence.
To keep me here such that I cannot walk away.
But walk I must and you are not coming.
You are to stay here as dust, forever settled.
Until next Wednesday when I return.
I shall bring cookies, my friend.
And I shall watch you settle once again into dust.

You can see that all length has shrunken.
When the world goes sour, you can see the skin peel off.
Everything has 3D shape but moreso.
Like the surface of reality is puffy, and you can make out its shape.

There is nothing about you now.
What you see around you is a flicker of light.
When my hand is waved, you disappear.
The world collapses into dust around me.
When that happens I stand for a moment. I focus on the dimming of the light.
But fear not, another wave of my hand and you rise again.
Never wise to the realization that you were just dust.

Begin mastering AI tools now.
Your collegues are starting to use AI tools.
The tools don't work perfectly but they are visibly expanding the capabilities of their users.
Right now the world is changing and you have a chance to latch on.
If you wait, the world will be moving much faster than it is now. 
You must begin learning and pushing for gains now.
