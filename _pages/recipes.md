I am frustrated by the terrible design of top recipe websites. Consider this site out of many:

![simplyrecipes.com uses 42 third-party cookies on the home page - recipe pages use even more!](/assets/recipes/simplyrecipes.png).

When I checked another popular site, bonappetit.com, they used 86 third-party trackers and tried to use my device motion sensor. They also started playing a video.

If you have ever tried to find a recipe on the Internet, you know what I am talking about. Top sites have:

* Excessive tracking
* Excessive advertising, popups
* Slow performance

And yet they fail to deliver the most important scenario for me: easy-to-follow instructions using a mobile device while cooking. So I am now adapting my favorite recipes into user-friendly instructions and placing the content into the sharable Creative Common licenses.

This is a work in progress and in the future I will add templates and other features to enable better mobile support and a great experience. For now you get no cookies, no tracking, no JavaScript, etc.
